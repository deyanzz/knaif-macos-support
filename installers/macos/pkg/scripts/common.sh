# NON-FATAL BY CONSTRUCTION (D13). A failed Homebrew or model download is reported to
# /var/log/install.log (script stdout lands there) and never fails the install: every script ends
# in `exit 0` and none uses `set -e`. The same rule as the Windows installer's [Run] entries.

# The target volume without its trailing slash ("" for the boot volume), so every absolute path is
# "$VOL/usr/local/knaif". Correct for another volume, and what lets the tests run these scripts
