; /DTestInstall moves a scratch verification build out of the real default directory. A throwaway

; so the defaults would break again the moment anyone ticks it. Flat names are the only shape in
; which per-task defaults survive.

; The same Check stays on the [Run] entry: it guards the gap between the wizard page and the install
; step. The description states that setup waits, because the [Run] entry has no `nowait` and Inno
; disables Cancel during that stage — the wait is disclosed where the user opts in, not when it starts.

; The opt-in NVIDIA CUDA backend. Re-enabled for 1.1.0: v1 shipped no such component precisely
; because `knaif backend install` did not exist for it to call, and an opt-in task with no command
; behind it is worse than no offer.
;
; Hidden entirely unless CudaOfferable. Three conditions, all of which must hold: an NVIDIA GPU is
; present, its driver meets the CUDA 13 floor, and the backend is not already installed. Below the
; floor the payload would download and then fail to load; on an AMD box the offer is pure noise.
;
; CHECKED BY DEFAULT (changed 2026-07-30). This is deliberately NOT the Ghostscript/LibreOffice
; defect repeated: those two render on every machine that picks the documents skill, so a checked
; default pushed an AGPL tool and a ~350 MB suite onto users who had shown no sign of needing
; either. This task is rendered ONLY on a machine already proven to benefit — NVIDIA silicon, a
; driver above the floor, no payload yet — and there, leaving it off means the user finishes setup
; running inference on the CPU/Vulkan path while the hardware to do better sits idle. The size is
; stated, the tick is one click away, and `knaif backend install cuda` is the identical command
; afterwards, so the cost of the wrong default is small in the direction we have now chosen and
; large in the other.
;
; The description discloses the wait for the same reason getmodel's does: the [Run] entry has no
; `nowait` and Inno disables Cancel during that stage. Now that the task is checked by default the
; disclosure is doing real work — it is read by the user deciding whether to UNtick.

// BEFORE knaif is installed, so it cannot call the CLI and probes nvidia-smi directly. Two
// deliberate simplifications against the runtime version: it does not read compute capability (the
// wizard has one offer, not two strengths), and it detects an existing payload by file presence
// rather than by receipt (the CLI does the authoritative check and will simply re-install).
//
// Probed ONCE and cached: `Check:` is evaluated repeatedly — per wizard page and again at install
// time — and spawning nvidia-smi each time would make the wizard visibly stutter.
//
// It is also STARTED EARLY AND ASYNCHRONOUSLY, which is the whole reason this is three routines
// instead of one. nvidia-smi costs 1-2s on a box that actually has a driver (it initialises one to
// answer), and the first `Check:` evaluation lands when Inno rebuilds the task list — i.e. on the
// Next click that leaves the Components page. Run synchronously there, that is a wizard which
// simply stops responding for a second or two with nothing on screen to say why, and a blocking
// Exec cannot be narrated: the message loop is not running, so no spinner would animate and no
// caption would repaint. The fix is not to decorate the wait but to have already spent it — the
// probe is launched with ewNoWait when the wizard is created, and by the time the user has read
// the licence and picked components the answer is sitting in a file.
