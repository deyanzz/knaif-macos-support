# macOS Support — Metal inference, packaging, signing, and a third release platform

**Status:** Active · **Created:** 2026-08-02 · **Completed:** —
**Owner:** native/packaging · **Ref:** [`installers/macos/README.md`](../../installers/macos/README.md) (placeholder this plan replaces) · [`installers/package.sh`](../../installers/package.sh) · [`docs/NATIVE.md`](../NATIVE.md) §5, §9, §10, §12 · [`docs/RELEASE.md`](../RELEASE.md) · [post-v1-ci-and-cuda-opt-in](2026-07-17-post-v1-ci-and-cuda-opt-in.md) (C3 matrix, §*Out of scope*)
**Release:** 1.3.0 · release index: [release-1.3.0](2026-09-30-release-1.3.0.md)

> **Synced with 1.2.0 on 2026-09-30** (merge of `main` into this branch, done on Windows). What
> changed for the remaining work:
> - **C0 is superseded.** Release 1.2 re-locked both snapshots for the shipped models; the merge
>   takes `main`'s snapshots. **C4/C5/C6 and the L4 run against `knaif-qwen3-4b-v2`** and those
>   committed snapshots — no re-lock (§11).
> - **Builds go through 1.2's per-kind profiles.** `metal` is a kind like the others:
>   `just build-native-kind metal` → `target/release-metal/`, then
>   `installers/package.sh --no-build --kind=metal --profile=release-metal`, or `just package-native
>   metal` for both. `scripts/build_native_kind.sh` now sets the OpenSSL guard and
>   `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` (default 12.0).
> - **Feature sets come from `package.sh --print-feats=<kind>`.** `openmp` is explicit on
>   cpu/vulkan/cuda (so Windows/Linux build exactly as 1.2.0 did) and absent on metal; every kind
>   carries `pdfium`, and `build_native_kind.sh` stages the pinned `mac-arm64` PDFium.
> - The branch's own `just package-native` recipe, Windows notes and `eval-snapshot` default were
>   replaced by 1.2's equivalents; its "skill must own the verifier" snapshot check was kept.
> - **Not yet verified on a Mac after the merge:** everything Darwin-only. Re-run A2/A3, B, C1 and
>   E1/E2 before building on them.
> - **`just check` fails at `check-gate` on this branch, and that is correct:** the native sources
>   changed (`knaif-llm` features, `llama.rs`), so 1.2.0's L3/L4 evidence reads stale for both
>   skills. It clears when L3/L4 are re-run on this tree (the 1.3.0 gates). Everything else in
>   `just check` passed on Windows at the merge (Python 3002 passed, native, contracts, site); CI
>   does not run the gate.
>
> **Status note (2026-08-02).** Not started. macOS has been explicitly out of scope since
> [monorepo-dual-runtime](2026-06-17-monorepo-dual-runtime.md) Phase 9 and is still listed as a
> known limitation in [NATIVE.md](../NATIVE.md) §12 ("no installers/notarization; explicitly out for
> v1"). The Rust core was kept cross-platform on purpose, so this plan is **packaging, signing, and
> verification work with a small amount of build plumbing** — not a port. The inference question is
> already answered by the vendored sources (§1); the risk lives in §5–§8.
>
> **Execution target: a current macOS on Apple Silicon** — but not exclusively. Building, signing,
> notarizing and running anything Darwin needs the Mac. **`scripts/check_macho_deps.py` (E1), the
> `package.sh` branches (§5), the feature-graph change (D3), and the eval-snapshot prerequisite
> (C0) can and should be written and tested from the Windows box**, which is the whole design of
> the existing `check_pe_imports.py` / `check_elf_deps.py` pair: a static checker must fail where
> the mistake was made, not only on the platform that suffers it.
>
> **Reviewed 2026-08-02** against an external audit; every finding was re-verified against the code
> before being accepted. The audit's six blocking findings all held and are folded in below — the
> substantive ones were C0 (the regression gate proved nothing), C5's binary, and the feature-graph
> error in D3. Two audit claims were corrected rather than adopted (A5's `@executable_path`
> rationale, and the OpenMP failure's exact shape); one was found to understate the problem (the
> `documents` snapshot is stale too, not just `ffmpeg`).

**Goal:** Ship knaif on macOS as a first-class third platform — a signed, notarized arm64 artifact
with Metal GPU inference, verified by the same eval/parity/clean-room gates Windows and Linux
already pass, and cut by the same `RELEASE.md` procedure.

## 0. Start here

*Added 2026-09-30 — the handoff for whoever builds this on a Mac, human or agent.* Read this
section, then §2 (decisions) and the workstream you are picking up. Everything below §2 is
the detailed record; this section is the map.

**How work flows (git).**

1. Fork `blackdeep-tech/knaif`. Keep your fork's `feat/macos-support` as a **mirror** of ours
   — never commit on it directly.
2. For each piece of work, cut a short topic branch from it (`mac/<topic>`, for example
   `mac/metal-rebuild`) and open a PR from your fork into **our `feat/macos-support`**. Small
   PRs, one workstream step each, so review stays quick.
3. Before starting a new topic, update the mirror from ours. The owner merges `release/1.3.0`
   (and through it `main`) into `feat/macos-support` whenever they move. **Merge, never rebase** a
   shared branch.
4. When §13 holds, the owner opens one PR from `feat/macos-support` into `release/1.3.0`, merged
   with a merge commit. `release/1.3.0` only ever receives finished macOS work.

Why a fork: fork PRs never see repository secrets, which keeps the signing identities (F, and
the owner's [certificate steps](2026-09-30-macos-signing-certificates.md)) away from branch work by construction.

**Who does what.**

| Who | Does |
|---|---|
| Owner | Certificates and the notarization key ([macos-signing-certificates](2026-09-30-macos-signing-certificates.md)), the Homebrew tap repository, merges, release cuts |
| Contributor (Mac) | Workstreams M–G on Apple Silicon: build, package, sign and notarize the first build **by hand**, the evals, the clean room |
| Windows box | Everything that does not need a Mac to run: scripts, tests against faked Apple tools, CI, docs, the 1.2.0 reference extract |

**Where it stands (2026-09-30).** The branch was synced with 1.2.0 on Windows (see the note at
the top), and then everything that could be written without a Mac was — each piece tested on
Windows and on Linux (WSL) against faked Apple tools, and **none of it run on a Mac yet**:

| Piece | Where | Task |
|---|---|---|
| a `knaif` reached through a symlink (the `.pkg`'s PATH link, Homebrew's) resolves its real folder before looking for skills, contracts and backends — macOS reports the invoked path | `knaif-core` `current_exe_real`, `llama.rs` | found here; F5, G5 |
| the dependency probe searches `macos.dirs` (Homebrew's `bin`, the LibreOffice cask's `.app`) and hints the exact `brew install` | `deps.rs`, both `skill.yaml` | C7 |
| `models pull` keeps `~/.knaif/models` out of Time Machine | `knaif-models`, CLI | F5b (D18) |
| the `.pkg`: Distribution with the options page, per-choice packages, install scripts, `uninstall.sh` | `installers/macos/build-pkg.sh`, `pkg/` | F5 (D13) |
| signing, notarization log check, stapling, the F2 order end to end | `sign.sh`, `notarize.sh`, `release.sh`, `scripts/check_macos_signing.py`, `check_macho_deps.py --list` | F2, F3, F3b, F6, F7 |
| the clean room, guest side | `installers/macos/clean-room.sh` | E3, E4, E6 (D16) |
| the Homebrew formula and its renderer | `installers/macos/homebrew/` | G5 (D19) |
| CI: path-filtered macOS job; tag-time signing job, off until `MACOS_SIGNING=enabled` | `ci.yml`, `release.yml` | G6 (D10, D11) |
| the 1.2.0 L4 per-row reference and the comparison tool | `evals/parity/1.2.0-l4-rows/`, `scripts/l4_rows.py` | C6→D14 (D17) |
| macOS eval lanes `mac-4b`, `mac-1.7b`, `mac-cpu-4b`, `mac-cpu-1.7b` | `eval_backends.yaml` | C4 |
| docs: RELEASE.md (§1, §2, §4, §5, §6), NATIVE.md §5.3, `installers/macos/README.md` | | G1, G2, G3 |

**The Mac's list — only what needs a Mac, in this order.** Record each result under its task,
commit it on a `mac/<topic>` branch, and PR into `feat/macos-support`. Then hand back: the Windows
box takes over the write-ups, the gate and the release integration.

1. **Re-verify the build** (A2/A3, B, C1, E1/E2): `just bootstrap`, `just check-native`,
   `just test-native`, `just package-native metal`, `bash installers/smoke.sh
   dist/knaif-*-macos-arm64.zip`, and the installer tests under macOS's bash 3.2: `uv run pytest
   python/core/tests/test_installer_pkg.py python/core/tests/test_macos_release.py
   python/core/tests/test_macos_signing.py python/core/tests/test_macho_deps.py`.
2. **The symlink fix, for real:** `ln -s "$PWD"/dist/staging/knaif-*-macos-arm64/bin/knaif
   /tmp/knaif && cd /tmp && ./knaif skills list && ./knaif run documents --verbose "<request>"` —
   skills found, Metal selected, layers offloaded.
3. **M3:** is the Command Line Tools alone enough to build? (A CLT-only tart VM answers it.)
4. **The `.pkg` by hand (F5, E6 static):** `just package-pkg`, open it — the options page, the
   tool choices greyed without Homebrew and enabled with it, a tool installed, the model
   downloaded, the PATH link, the conclusion page; `pkgutil --expand` it; then
   `sudo /usr/local/knaif/uninstall.sh`. Note anything that surprises you under F5.
5. **The evals on Metal (C4, D14):** unpack the zip into the lanes' folders (the comment above
   `mac-4b` in `eval_backends.yaml`), then per model and skill: `just eval-fixtures <skill>`,
   `uv run python -m knaif.evalsuite native --skill <skill> --lane mac-<model> --verifier success
   --config eval_backends.yaml --save <dir>`, `just eval-safety-native <skill> <save.json>`,
   `just eval-accept-native <skill> <board> <safety>`. Then the CPU sample on `mac-cpu-<model>`
   with `--only evals/runs/2026-09-29_r5c-linux_success/t15_sample_<model>_<skill>.json`.
6. **Row flips (D14/D17):** `uv run python scripts/l4_rows.py compare
   evals/parity/1.2.0-l4-rows/<platform>-<model>-<backend>-<skill>.json <mac board> --list`
   against Windows CUDA and Linux CUDA (Metal boards) and the Linux CPU sample (CPU boards).
7. **L3 parity (C5):** `just parity <skill>` for both skills, per C5's note on the build to use.
8. **Performance (D1–D6)** — the PERFORMANCE.md rows.
9. **Signing, once the owner's certificates arrive (F1, F4, D10):** `just release-macos` with no
   entitlements first; keep `dist/notary/`.
10. **The clean room (E3, E4, E6, D16):** the three tart runs in `installers/macos/README.md`, on
    the files step 9 produced; then Metal on the physical Mac from a fresh user account.

Known gaps the Mac will meet: `just parity` still hard-codes `target/debug/knaif` (C5's note);
Homebrew may rewrite the dylibs' install names and drop the Developer ID signature (G5's note).

**Known red, on purpose.** `just check` fails at `check-gate` on this branch: the native
sources changed, so 1.2.0's L3/L4 evidence reads as stale for both skills. It clears when L3/L4
are re-run on this tree as part of the 1.3.0 gates. Do not "fix" it by re-locking snapshots —
§11 forbids that.

**Decisions to build to, not re-open.** D1–D9 below, plus the owner's 2026-09-30 decisions
D10–D19. If the Mac shows one of them is wrong, record the evidence and raise it with the owner
before changing course.

**Handback from the Mac, 2026-10-05 (M1 Pro, macOS 27.2).** Steps 1–8 of the Mac's list are done
and recorded under their tasks; steps 9–10 are blocked on the certificates. No decision D1–D19
was found wrong. PRs, all merged into the `feat/macos-support` of the Mac contributor's fork:
#1 build fixes (step 1), #2 symlink (2), #3 Command Line Tools (3), #4 `.pkg` (4), #5 L4 and row
flips (5–6), #6 L3 (7), #7 performance (8), #8 the L4 re-run on the merged tree, #10 the merge of
`main` (1.2.1). The upstream PRs `blackdeep-tech/knaif#77` and `#78` were closed in favour of #1.

| Step | Result | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Build re-check | **passed after three fixes**: proc macros unstripped for macOS 27's dyld, the path remap on macOS, CI on `macos-15` | A2, E5, G6 |
| 2 Symlinked `knaif` | **passed**: skills, contracts and backends found through the link; Metal 37/37 | F5 |
| 3 M3 | **the Command Line Tools alone build and package the metal kind** | M3 |
| 4 `.pkg` | static half, install and uninstall **passed**; two findings (below) | E6 |
| 5 L4 Metal | 4B **ACCEPTED** on both skills, 1.7B documents **ACCEPTED**, 1.7B ffmpeg **NOT ACCEPTED** (one slice); safety 100%; a re-run on `af05956` was identical row for row | C4 |
| 5 CPU sample | recorded on the Metal-less tree; not composed into a cell | C4 |
| 6 Row flips | vs Windows/Linux CUDA: 4B 31/861 + 2/164, 1.7B 10/861 + 0/164; vs Linux CPU: at most 5/115 | C4, `evals/runs/2026-10-03_mac-l4_success` |
| 7 L3 | 3 of 4 **PASS**; 4B documents **FAIL** on one port bug | C5 |
| 8 Performance | `M1P` rows: Metal 4B 506 tok/s prompt / 16.9 tok/s generation, CPU 94 / 6.5 | D1, D2, D6, PERFORMANCE.md §2 |
| 9 Signing | **done 2026-10-06** with the owner's certificates: both notarizations Accepted, `.pkg` stapled, no entitlements needed; that build carries a home path and must be rebuilt outside `~` before release | F1, F4 |
| 10 Clean room | **next**: the three tart runs on a release build signed from a checkout outside `~` | E3, E4, E6 |

**Commit IDs in the Mac's records, 2026-10-08.** The fork's branch was rewritten before
`blackdeep-tech/knaif#82` (committer address), so three IDs its records cite are not in this
history. The files are unchanged: `8cbab23` is `8f09735` (2026-10-07 runs), `bdd01b5` is `23015d8`
(2026-10-05 runs). `af05956` was a merge on the fork with no counterpart here; the 2026-10-04 L4
re-run it names was superseded by the 2026-10-05 and 2026-10-07 runs. The run records keep the IDs
the tools wrote.

**Next round for the Mac (from 2026-10-08).** `release/1.3.0` (1.3.0's daemon, run prompting and
Windows fixes) is merged into `feat/macos-support`. Both branches must be in `release/1.3.0` before
the freeze, so the owner opens the PR `feat/macos-support` → `release/1.3.0` now, not at §13.
Two rounds remain: a rehearsal now, and the evidence on the frozen 1.3.0.

*The rule for every change.* Change only the macOS implementation: `installers/macos/**`,
`scripts/check_macos_signing.py`, `scripts/check_macho_deps.py`, the `Darwin`/`macos` branches of
shared build scripts, the `macos:` blocks in `skill.yaml`, the `mac-*` lanes in `eval_backends.yaml`,
macOS docs, and your own `evals/` records. Anything else (native crates, skill code, Python,
contracts, the gate, shared scripts, CI for other platforms) you **report, not fix**, as a block at
the end of this section, and keep working around it:

```markdown
**Finding <YYYY-MM-DD>: <one line>**
- Where: <file:line, or the command>
- Seen: <exact output, or row id and verdict>
- Expected: <what should happen, and why: Python's result, a doc, a rule>
- Platforms: macOS only | probably every platform (why)
- Evidence: <evals/... path, or a log excerpt>
- Suggested fix (not applied): <optional>
```

*Before any work.*
1. Sync your fork's mirror once the owner says it is pushed: `git fetch upstream && git checkout
   feat/macos-support && git merge --ff-only upstream/feat/macos-support && git push origin
   feat/macos-support`. It fast-forwards: #82 is already inside it.
2. Work and build from a checkout **outside your home folder** (`/Users/Shared/knaif`, E5).
3. Before every push, both addresses must be your GitHub noreply address: `git log --format='%ae
   %ce' upstream/feat/macos-support..HEAD` prints nothing else.

*Round 1, now — rehearsal (version still 1.2.1, nothing here is release evidence).*
1. Step 1's checks on the merged tree (`just check-native`, `just test-native`, the installer tests
   under bash 3.2). New since your last build: `knaif daemon start | stop | status` and
   `run --daemon` (loopback TCP, its token in `~/.knaif/daemon.json`, a 10-minute idle timeout).
2. **The signed build.** First move the 2026-10-06 signed files out of `dist/` and rename that
   `.pkg` `old-1.2.1.pkg`: the new build has the same file names, and run 3 below upgrades from
   it. (It carries the old home path, but it is only ever installed inside the VM.) Then, from
   `/Users/Shared/knaif`, with the four `KNAIF_*` variables set as in `installers/macos/README.md`
   (*Sign, notarize, staple*): `just release-macos`. Its home-path check must pass. Keep `dist/notary/`.
3. **Step 10, the clean room**, on those files: the three tart runs in `installers/macos/README.md`
   (*The clean room*), each on a fresh clone, each ending `CLEAN ROOM PASS`:
   run 1 `--zip`; run 2 `--pkg --offline`, in the VM's own Terminal with networking off; run 3
   `--pkg --upgrade-from old-1.2.1.pkg`. Keep each run's `clean-room-results.txt` and logs. Both
   builds say 1.2.1, so run 3's `upgrade_receipt` passes trivially here; it means something at
   the freeze. (Fixed on Windows 2026-10-08, untested on a Mac: `clean-room.sh` now passes
   `--model` as an absolute path. Before, its runs looked for the GGUF from a scratch folder, did
   not find it, and `cpu_run` would have failed.)
4. **The daemon**, in run 3's VM after it finishes (its uninstall keeps `~/.knaif`). Written on
   Windows 2026-10-08 and tested only against a faked `sudo` and `stat`; this is its first run on
   a Mac. The `.pkg`'s preinstall runs the old binary's `knaif daemon stop` as the console user;
   `uninstall.sh` runs it as the user who ran sudo.

   ```bash
   cd ~/room
   sudo installer -pkg knaif-1.2.1-macos-arm64.pkg -target /
   knaif daemon start --model "$PWD/knaif-qwen3-4b-v2-q4_k_m.gguf"
   knaif daemon status                                 # running (pid N)
   sudo installer -pkg knaif-1.2.1-macos-arm64.pkg -target /
   pgrep -fl 'knaif daemon serve' || echo DAEMON-GONE  # must print DAEMON-GONE
   grep 'knaif' /var/log/install.log | tail -5         # "knaif daemon stopped.", no "could not stop"
   knaif daemon start --model "$PWD/knaif-qwen3-4b-v2-q4_k_m.gguf"
   sudo /usr/local/knaif/uninstall.sh
   pgrep -fl 'knaif daemon serve' || echo DAEMON-GONE  # must print DAEMON-GONE
   ```

5. **Metal on the physical Mac, from a fresh user account** (E3's split, D16; D3's first-run
   cost). Make a standard user in System Settings and log in as them. Bring the `.zip` in the way
   a browser does (Safari, or `xattr -w com.apple.quarantine` as `clean-room.sh` does) and extract
   it with Finder. Copy `/Users/Shared/knaif/sandbox/fixtures/documents/sample.pdf` into a work
   folder and, from there, run twice:
   `<extracted>/bin/knaif run documents --yes --verbose --model
   /Users/Shared/knaif/models/knaif-qwen3-4b-v2-q4_k_m.gguf "rotate sample.pdf 90 degrees"`.
   The first run's time is D3's cold number, the second its warm one; both must show `offloaded
   N/N layers` on `MTL`.
6. Record under E3, E4, E6 (and D3 for the times), PR into `feat/macos-support`, and hand back. Do
   not re-run L3/L4 now: the freeze changes the binary again, and only the frozen build counts.

**Round 1 handback, 2026-10-09: every step passes**, on the signed 1.2.1 build of `49b4e95`
(record: `evals/runs/2026-10-09_mac-rehearsal-1.3.0_cleanroom/`). Steps 1–2 clean, both
notarizations Accepted; step 3's three runs pass in a macOS 12.6 VM; step 4's daemon is stopped on
reinstall and uninstall; step 5 offloads 37/37 from a fresh account, cold 18.93 s / warm 3.40 s.
Three changes, macOS files only: the clean room's VM is built from Apple's IPSW (Cirrus' vanilla
image ships the Command Line Tools), `clean-room.sh` gives `smoke.sh` the `Cargo.toml` it reads,
and the preinstall logs when nobody is logged in. Round 2 copies `Cargo.toml` into the room
(README). Details under E3, E4, E6, D3.

*Round 2, at the freeze.* The owner announces the freeze commit on `release/1.3.0` (version 1.3.0).
Work from that commit, not from `feat/macos-support`. The rules are the release plan's
[pre-registered gate rules](2026-09-30-release-1.3.0.md#gate-decision-rules-pre-registered-2026-10-07-before-any-130-evidence-run):
copy them verbatim into your `run_all.sh`, as the Windows and Linux scripts do, and change none of
them after a result. Launch each stage only after the owner approves it with its time budget.
1. `just release-macos` from `/Users/Shared` at the freeze commit; record the sha256 of the signed
   `.zip` and `.pkg`. Everything below runs on that `.zip`.
2. **L4 Metal**, both models × both skills, with `KNAIF_NO_DAEMON=1` (step 5's commands). The
   1.7B ffmpeg `batch` miss is waived by the rule; any other miss goes to the owner.
3. **The macOS CPU cell is composed, as 1.2.0 did it** (owner, 2026-10-07): run the `t15_sample`
   rows on `mac-cpu-<model>` and both safety sets on that binary. The Windows box composes them
   into your Metal board and grades the cell; flips are reported, not a verdict.
4. **Daemon plan equality**, both models: `knaif plan --skill <skill> --batch <utterances> --json`
   over each skill's whole `eval.jsonl`, once with `KNAIF_NO_DAEMON=1` and once through
   `knaif daemon start`. The outputs must be byte-identical; the method is in
   `evals/parity/2026-10-06_daemon-plan-equality/README.md`. A difference goes to the owner.
5. **L3 on Metal** (step 7), recorded, not gated: the gate's L3 is the CUDA run on Windows.
6. **Step 10 again** on the frozen files, the rehearsal's cases included.
7. Commit the boards, safety files and verdicts under `evals/runs/<date>_r130-macos_success/`
   (the parity ones under `evals/parity/`), one row per run in `evals/INDEX.md`, and PR them into
   **`release/1.3.0`**. Evidence and macOS notes only. Code changes go to the owner first, by the
   rule above.

**Needs the owner:**
1. **1.7B ffmpeg misses `batch`** by one row (25/29 against 0.896, the 1.7B's own Python score). The
   same rows fail in both Mac runs; three fail on every 1.2.0 platform, and 1.2.0 recorded the same
   miss for Windows Vulkan 1.7B. Waive, retrain, or keep the 4B as the macOS recommendation (C4).
   **Decided 2026-10-07 (owner): waived as on Windows** — the 1.3.0 release plan's waiver rule.
2. **`documents_105`: native's dry run accepts a `reorder_pages` order its execution rejects**;
   Python rejects it in both. Platform-independent. **A fix with its L2 case is prepared and
   measured on the Mac (L3 now passes), and merged in #14**; documents L3/L4 still to
   re-run on Windows and Linux (C5). **Decided 2026-10-07 (owner): in 1.3.0**, merged upstream in
   `blackdeep-tech/knaif#82`. On Windows, 2026-10-08: a chain's input that an earlier step has yet
   to write is checked when the step runs, as `remove_pages` does, so `knaif run` still previews
   "merge, then reverse the pages".
3. **`.pkg` findings** (E6): `._*` AppleDouble entries in the payload from `com.apple.provenance`
   (harmless on install; on this Mac neither `xattr -cr` nor `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` removes them,
   because macOS re-adds the attribute to every file written, see E6), and the script-only choices
   (PATH link, model, tools) leave no receipt: `uninstall.sh` does not need one (it checks the
   link's target and removes the install folder), but nothing records which choices were taken.
4. **Release contracts:** `platforms.yaml` lists `macos` as `planned` but without artifacts or
   requirements, and `acceptance_matrix.yaml` has no macOS cells; the recorded cells are keyed
   `<model>|macos|mtl` (C4). *(Corrected 2026-10-06: this item first said `platforms.yaml` had no
   macOS entry, which was wrong.)*
5. **The macOS CPU cell**: compose it from the sample, as Linux was (T15s), or run it in full (C4).
   **Decided 2026-10-07 (owner): composed, as 1.2.0 did it**; flips are reported, not a verdict.
6. **Certificates and notary credentials**: received and working (F1, 2026-10-06).

**Stale since the 1.2.1 merge (#10).** 1.2.1 changed native code, so `just check-gate` reads L3/L4
stale for the Windows and Linux cells; L1/L2 were re-recorded on the merged tree. **The macOS L3/L4
were re-run on that tree on 2026-10-05** with the same decisions as before (C4, C5); its four
`macos|mtl` cells are current. They need re-running again only if the native code changes once more
(for example a `documents_105` fix). **Stale again since 2026-10-08**: the merge of `release/1.3.0`
changed native code. They are re-run once, on the frozen 1.3.0 (*Next round*, round 2), not before.

**Still needs a person:** the installer's screens judged by whoever installs (E6); the first-run
shader tax from a fresh user account (D3); D4 on an 8 GB Mac; D5's OpenMP comparison; and step 10's
offline pass and Metal check from a fresh account.

**macOS 27.2 Beta 2 (2026-10-05)** needs no re-build or re-run: the toolchain is unchanged, dyld's
proc-macro rejection is fixed, the merged tree builds and packages, and the 1.2.0 binary gives the
same plan and grade on 339 probed rows (A2). E5 and F5b were closed and M3 ticked the same day.

## 1. Research: which inference stack — "Metal or llama.cpp?"

**The question dissolves on contact: Metal *is* the llama.cpp backend on Apple.** `ggml-metal` is a
first-class ggml backend that sits behind the same `LlmBackend` trait knaif already dispatches
through. There is no fork in the road here; the real fork would be leaving llama.cpp entirely for
Apple's own stacks, and that is rejected below.

Everything in this section was verified by reading the **vendored** `llama-cpp-sys-2 0.1.150`
sources this workspace already pins (`~/.cargo/registry/src/*/llama-cpp-sys-2-0.1.150/`), not from
memory or upstream docs. Line references are to that copy.

### 1.1 What the pinned crate already does on Apple

| Finding | Where | Consequence for knaif |
|---|---|---|
| `GGML_METAL` defaults **ON** when `APPLE` | `llama.cpp/ggml/CMakeLists.txt:95-103, 239` (`GGML_METAL_DEFAULT`) | **No new cargo feature is needed.** A plain `--features llama` build on macOS compiles the Metal backend. |
| `llama-cpp-sys-2`'s `metal` feature is **declared but never read** | `Cargo.toml:86` vs. no `feature = "metal"` in `build.rs` | Adding a `metal` feature to `knaif-llm` that forwards to it would be **a lie in the feature graph**. Do not add one. See D2. |
| `GGML_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY` defaults to `${GGML_METAL}` = ON | `ggml/CMakeLists.txt:242`; `ggml/src/ggml-metal/CMakeLists.txt` | The Metal shader library is **embedded into the backend binary** via an `.incbin` asm stub — there is **no `default.metallib` to stage**. This removes the single most obvious packaging hazard before it exists. |
| `ggml_add_backend_library(ggml-metal …)` | `ggml/src/ggml-metal/CMakeLists.txt` | Under `GGML_BACKEND_DL` it becomes a loadable **`libggml-metal.dylib`**, exactly like `libggml-vulkan.so`. **`dynamic-backends` works on macOS with no new mechanism.** ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-08-03, verified on hardware (A4): the actual file is `libggml-metal.so`, not `.dylib`.** CMake's `MODULE` library type (used for `GGML_BACKEND_DL` targets) suffixes `.so` on Apple too — only `SHARED` targets get `.dylib`. `has_backend_libs` in `knaif-llm` is unaffected (it checks the `ggml-` prefix, not the extension) and ggml's own `load_backends_from_path` dlopens it fine — confirmed empirically: `load_backend: loaded MTL backend from …/libggml-metal.so`, 37/37 layers offloaded. **This does matter for B3/B1**: any packaging step that globs `libggml-*.dylib` to decide what to stage/sign will silently miss these files. Glob `libggml-*.{dylib,so}` (or just `libggml-*` minus the core libs) on Darwin. |
| `GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS` supports Apple ARM: `apple_m1` (DOTPROD), `apple_m2_m3` (+MATMUL_INT8), `apple_m4` (+SME) | `ggml/src/CMakeLists.txt:403-430` | The runtime CPU-variant dispatch that the Windows/Linux artifacts rely on **also works here**, and specialises per Apple generation. Three `ggml-cpu-*` libs, not nine to fourteen. Confirmed on hardware (A4): `libggml-cpu-apple_m1.so`, `_m2_m3.so`, `_m4.so` all built; `apple_m2_m3` correctly selected at runtime on this M3 Pro. |
| Frameworks linked: `Foundation`, `Metal`, `MetalKit`, `Accelerate`, `libc++` | `build.rs:1157-1176` | **All system frameworks. Nothing redistributable, no NVIDIA-shaped payload, no EULA.** Confirmed via `otool -L` on every staged Mach-O (A4/A5): only system framework paths, `libc++`, and `@rpath` to the artifact's own core libs — no third-party dependency anywhere. |
| `GGML_BLAS` is forced **OFF** on Apple by the crate | `build.rs:673` | Accelerate is linked but not used as the BLAS provider. Affects the CPU fallback path only; note it, don't fight it. Confirmed: `GGML_BLAS:BOOL=OFF`, `GGML_BLAS_VENDOR:STRING=Apple` in `CMakeCache.txt`. |
| `openmp` is a **default feature** of `llama-cpp-2` → `GGML_OPENMP=ON` | `llama-cpp-2/Cargo.toml` `default = ["openmp", …]`; `sys/build.rs:891` | ⚠️ **Fully measured and fixed, 2026-08-07 (B5).** `brew install libomp` alone did not reproduce the trap — it is keg-only, so plain `find_package(OpenMP)` still misses it. It reproduces once the build environment resolves the keg (`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp`, which is exactly what many unrelated Homebrew formulae's own build recipes export): `GGML_OPENMP_ENABLED` flips ON and `libggml-base.dylib` + every `ggml-cpu-*` backend links `/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib/libomp.dylib` — caught correctly by `check_macho_deps.py` (E1). D3's fix (an explicit, opt-in `openmp` Cargo feature, off on macOS) is implemented and verified to hold even under that exact trap-triggering environment — see B5. |

### 1.2 What this means for the artifact shape

- **One default artifact per OS holds unchanged (C5b).** On Windows/Linux that artifact is the
  `vulkan` kind because Vulkan is one extra loadable lib beside the CPU backends. On macOS the same
  role is played by Metal — except Metal costs *no extra cargo feature at all*, so the macOS default
  artifact's feature set is literally `llama,dynamic-backends`.
- **There is no opt-in payload on macOS, and there never will be one.** The whole `backend install`
  surface exists because CUDA is ~668 MB of NVIDIA redistributables. Metal is a system framework;
  `libggml-metal.dylib` is small and ships in the default artifact. `backend list` must therefore
  report *"unavailable on this platform"* for `cuda` (it already does — verified in
  `backend_store.rs` / `main.rs:476`) and the first-run CUDA nudge must stay silent (`nvidia-smi`
  does not exist).
- **`vulkan` and `cuda` are not macOS kinds.** MoltenVK was considered and is rejected in D1.

### 1.3 ⚠️ The OpenMP trap, third instance

`llama-cpp-2`'s **default** features include `openmp`, so `build.rs` sets `GGML_OPENMP=ON`, and
ggml then runs `find_package(OpenMP)`. On Apple Clang there is no OpenMP runtime in the toolchain —
**but there is one in Homebrew** (`brew install libomp`, pulled in by dozens of unrelated formulae).
If CMake finds it, `libggml-base.dylib` links `/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib/libomp.dylib`, an
absolute path that **does not exist on a clean Mac**.

This is precisely the failure that shipped in every 1.0.x artifact twice already, under two names:

| OS | Library | How it was found | How it presented |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | `VCOMP140.dll` | Windows Sandbox clean room | `0xC0000135` at process start, printing nothing |
| Linux | `libgomp.so.1` | `scripts/check_elf_deps.py` | CPU backends fail to load on a box without GCC |
| **macOS** | **`libomp.dylib`** | **must be caught by B5 / E1 below** | **backend load failure on a Mac without Homebrew** |

It resolves on the build box for the same reason both predecessors did: the build box has the
toolchain. **Do not assume the outcome either way** — `find_package(OpenMP)` may simply fail on a
stock toolchain, in which case ggml warns and disables it. Measure it (B5), then take D3.

> **⚠️ The failure will probably not look like a Homebrew path, and a checker that greps for one
> will miss it.** LLVM builds `libomp.dylib` with an `LC_ID_DYLIB` of **`@rpath/libomp.dylib`**, so
> the dependent's load command carries no `/opt/homebrew/…` string at all — it is non-portable
> because the `@rpath` target is *absent on the user's machine*, not because the path is visibly
> foreign. **E1 must therefore reject any dependency that does not RESOLVE**, and treat visible
> non-system path prefixes as a secondary signal only. This is the difference between a check that
> catches the bug and one that reports a clean bill of health on a broken artifact.

### 1.4 Rejected alternatives

- **MLX / Core ML / Apple Foundation Models — for *this artifact*.** A separate inference stack: no
  GGUF, no llama.cpp, no shared greedy-decode path. Adopting one *for the macOS CLI* would fork
  `knaif-llm`'s only real backend and cost the property that makes the eval numbers comparable —
  *the same GGUF, greedy-decoded, produces the same plan everywhere* — while buying nothing, because
  Metal already gives this artifact full GPU inference for no extra cargo feature (§1.1). The knaif
  value proposition is the deterministic plan pipeline, not the tensor kernels.

  > **Scope of this rejection.** It is about **the macOS CLI's backend**, not a verdict on Apple's
  > inference stacks in general. A surface with different constraints — no shell, a hard app memory
  > budget, no multi-GB download — is a different question with a different answer, and evaluating
  > that is neither in this plan's scope nor blocked by it. **Reconsider *here*** only if Metal
  > measurements (§7) come in badly, and then as its own plan.
- **MoltenVK (Vulkan-over-Metal).** Strictly worse than Metal on every axis: it is a translation
  layer *above* the API ggml already targets natively, it adds a redistributable to sign and notarize,
  and it would put macOS on the Vulkan code path whose Blackwell collapse
  ([PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md) §2) is the reason the CUDA payload exists at all. No.
- **Universal2 (`arm64` + `x86_64` in one binary).** See D4.

---

## 2. Decision log

**D1 — Metal, via llama.cpp, with no new cargo feature.** Per §1.1. The macOS default artifact is
built with `--features llama,dynamic-backends` and gets Metal for free because ggml defaults it ON
under `APPLE`. Adding a knaif `metal` feature would forward to a `llama-cpp-sys-2` feature that
`build.rs` never reads — a control that does nothing, which is worse than no control.

**D2 — `metal` is the *only* functional kind on macOS; `cpu` is refused there.** *Revised
2026-08-02 after audit.* The first draft said `--kind=metal` and `--kind=cpu` share a feature set
but stay distinguishable via `out_dir()`. **That was wrong, and the error is instructive:**
`out_dir()` identifies a build by the backends it emitted, and because `GGML_METAL` defaults ON
under `APPLE` (§1.1), a macOS `cpu` build emits `libggml-metal.dylib` too. The two kinds are not
merely feature-identical — they are **byte-identical builds**, so no `out_dir()` predicate can ever
separate them and one written to try would silently match both.

So: on Darwin, `metal` is the only functional kind, and `--kind=cpu` is **refused with a message
saying why**, exactly like `vulkan` and `cuda` (B1). This is strictly simpler than the alternative
(two staging profiles over one build) and it costs nothing, because there is no reason to publish a
CPU-only macOS artifact — Metal is a system framework, present on every supported machine.

> **A CPU-only *tree* is still needed, just not as a release kind.** §7's honest-CPU measurement and
> C5's CPU control both require one. Produce it by **copying a staged tree and deleting
> `libggml-metal.dylib`** — the loader then finds no Metal backend and cannot offload. That is a
> benchmarking procedure, not a build, and it is more trustworthy than `KNAIF_N_GPU_LAYERS=0`,
> which [PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md) §4 measured as **not CPU-only at all** (`op_offload`,
> an 11× error). One mechanism serves both needs.

**D3 — OpenMP: give knaif a real `openmp` feature and leave it off on macOS.** *Revised 2026-08-02
after audit; confirmed and implemented 2026-08-07 (B5).* If the build links Homebrew's libomp, the two
fixes are (a) stage `libomp.dylib` and rewrite its install name, or (b) turn `GGML_OPENMP` off for
the macOS artifact. Prefer (b) — ggml falls back to its own thread pool, macOS work is on Metal
anyway (`resolve_n_threads` matters only to the CPU fallback), and it removes a third-party binary
from the set that must be signed rather than adding one.

> **⚠️ The obvious implementation of (b) is a bug.** "Build with `llama-cpp-2`'s default features
> off" **also drops `common`** — `default = ["openmp", "android-shared-stdcxx", "common"]` — and
> `common` is what builds `llama-common`, which `package.sh` stages as a core lib on every platform.
> Silently losing it would break the artifact in a way unrelated to OpenMP.

The correct shape is an honest control, not a blunt one:

- declare `llama-cpp-2` with `default-features = false` **and an explicit `common`**;
- add a real `openmp` feature to `knaif-llm` (and forward it from `knaif-cli`);
- enable it for the Linux and Windows release kinds, which have shipped with it and whose
  `VCOMP140`/`libgomp` staging already assumes it;
- omit it for the macOS `metal` kind.

That adds a feature that genuinely controls something — the exact opposite of the fake `metal`
feature D1 rejects. Take (a) only if (b) measurably costs CPU-fallback throughput (§7 D5). libomp is
Apache-2.0-with-LLVM-exception, so either way there is no licence obstacle, only a complexity one.

**D4 — arm64 only. Not universal2, not a separate Intel artifact.** Apple Silicon is the entire
reason macOS is interesting for local inference (unified memory + a competent GPU in a laptop);
ggml's Metal backend on Intel Macs' AMD/Intel GPUs is a far weaker path, the last Intel Mac shipped
in 2020, and Apple's own support window for them is closing. Universal2 would double build time and
artifact size, and `GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS` emits *different* variant sets per architecture, so the
two halves are not symmetric and `lipo`ing the tree is more than a mechanical step. **Publish
`macos-arm64`; state Intel as unsupported in the release body rather than shipping something
untested.** Revisit only if real demand appears.

**D5 — the data directory stays `~/.knaif`.** Not `~/Library/Application Support/knaif`. knaif is a
Unix CLI, `~/.knaif` is what `KNAIF_MODELS_DIR`/`KNAIF_BACKENDS_DIR` default to on every platform,
and one path across three OSes is worth more than one platform's HIG convention for a tool with no
GUI. Recorded here so it is not re-litigated; revisit if a macOS GUI front-end ever lands.

**D6 — two artifacts: a `.zip` and a signed/notarized `.pkg`. Not a `.tar.gz`.** *Revised
2026-08-02 after audit.* The `.pkg` exists because **it is the only shape a CLI's notarization
ticket can be *stapled* to** — `stapler` accepts `.app`, `.dmg` and `.pkg`, and nothing else.
Without a staple, first run on a quarantined download needs Apple's notary service to be reachable,
so a user offline or behind a filtering proxy gets a Gatekeeper block on a correctly notarized
build.

The archive is a `.zip` rather than the `.tar.gz` Linux ships, breaking symmetry deliberately:
**Apple's notary service accepts `.zip`, `.pkg` and `.dmg` — not `.tar.gz`.** Publishing a tarball
would mean notarizing a `.zip` of the same tree and then shipping a *different container*, so the
thing verified and the thing downloaded are never the same file. That works (notarization registers
the binaries' CDHashes, not the container) but it is a gap nobody can inspect, and `.zip` is the
native macOS archive idiom anyway. `.dmg` was considered and rejected: a drag-to-Applications idiom
for `.app` bundles that communicates nothing useful for a `bin/knaif`.

**Homebrew tap is a deliberate fast-follow** (G5) — the best macOS channel for a CLI, and it
sidesteps quarantine entirely, but it depends on a published, checksummed archive existing first.
> **Superseded 2026-09-30 by D12:** the tap ships in 1.3.0; D19 sets the formula's shape.

**D7 — do NOT add a fourth version declaration; derive it.** *Reversed 2026-08-02 after audit.* The
first draft said the `.pkg` version "joins `test_version_consistency.py`". Wrong instinct: that test
exists to catch drift between declarations that **must** be written by hand
(`Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `knaif.iss`, the backend manifest), and the right move is to
*avoid creating a fourth* rather than to police one. `package.sh` already derives `VER` from
`Cargo.toml`; `pkgbuild --version` takes it from the same variable, so there is nothing to drift.
**Verify by inspecting the built package** (`pkgutil --expand` / the receipt's version) rather than
by adding a committed source of truth. The cheapest declaration to keep honest is the one that does
not exist.

**D8 — the macOS clean room is a VM, it is required, and it runs the OLDEST supported macOS.**
[RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) §4 already states the rule this plan inherits: *a verification step that
runs on the build box tests staging, never portability*, and it explicitly names macOS as a new
artifact shape needing its own clean-room run. On macOS the build box has Xcode Command Line Tools
and almost certainly Homebrew — the two things whose absence this must prove irrelevant. *Tightened
2026-08-02 after audit:* a clean **current** macOS tests the toolchain assumption but says nothing
about the deployment floor, so the minimum supported OS is what the gate must run (D9), and the run
must include real inference (E3), not just `--version`.

**D9 — the macOS deployment floor is a DECISION made before the first functional build, not an open
question.** *Added 2026-08-02 after audit.* The first draft demoted `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to
§12's open questions. That contradicts this project's own hard-won rule from
[portable-builds](2026-07-27-portable-builds.md): **the floor is a property of the artifact, chosen,
not inherited from whichever machine built it.** Linux pays for a whole pinned container to get
this right; macOS gets it for one environment variable, and there is no excuse for leaving it to
whatever SDK happens to be installed.

Two mechanical traps make it worse than it looks:

- **`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is not a build-script rerun trigger.** Verified against the pinned
  crate: `build.rs` declares `rerun-if-env-changed` for `LLAMA_LIB_PROFILE`, `CUDA_PATH`,
  `ROCM_PATH` and others — **not** for the deployment target. Combined with `always_configure(false)`
  (which [RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) §2 already documents as the reason a `CUDAARCHS` change needs a
  clean), **changing the floor after a cached build silently keeps the old one.** Same trap, new
  costume. Set it before compiling, and use a dedicated `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` for release builds.
- **A stated floor that nothing verifies is exactly the pattern that has already burned this
  project twice.** Assert `LC_BUILD_VERSION` on **every** staged Mach-O (E1), and run the clean-room
  VM on the **oldest supported** macOS — not merely a clean current one, which tests nothing about
  the floor.

**D10–D15 — owner decisions, 2026-09-30.** Made when macOS was scoped into 1.3.0
([release-1.3.0](2026-09-30-release-1.3.0.md)). They settle questions the tasks below had left
open; where a task's older text disagrees, these win and the task is updated to match.

- **D10 — signing: by hand first, then CI.** The first signed and notarized build is made on the
  contributor's Mac. After that works, a tag build in GitHub Actions signs and notarizes from
  repository secrets on a protected `release` environment, so the owner can cut a macOS release
  without a Mac. The owner's steps and the secret names: [macos-signing-certificates](2026-09-30-macos-signing-certificates.md). (F1, G6.)
- **D11 — CI: a macOS arm64 job, path-filtered** to `native/`, `installers/`, `scripts/` and the
  Cargo files, so Python-only and docs PRs do not queue for a macOS runner. (G6.)
- **D12 — artifacts: `.pkg` (recommended) + portable `.zip` + a Homebrew tap, all in 1.3.0.** The
  tap is `blackdeep-tech/homebrew-knaif`; the owner creates the repository. **No `.dmg`** — it
  has no install logic to offer a CLI that is not an `.app` (D6). (G5.)
- **D13 — the `.pkg` installs system-wide and always shows its options.** Payload in
  `/usr/local/knaif`, a `/usr/local/bin/knaif` symlink, admin install. The options page is always
  shown (`customize="always"` in a Distribution package), mirroring the Windows installer: skills,
  Homebrew tools (installed as the console user; greyed out when `brew` is absent), model download
  (setup waits for it) and the PATH symlink. Ships an `uninstall.sh`. A failed model download or
  `brew` install **never fails the install** — it is reported and can be redone later. (F5.)
- **D14 — evals on the Mac.** 4B and 1.7B: full L4 + safety on Metal. The CPU-only tree: sampled
  and composed, the way 1.2.0 did Linux CPU. L3 parity. Row-level flips compared against Windows
  (and Linux, from the WSL data) through a committed compact per-row extract of the 1.2.0 L4
  results. (C.)
- **D15 — floor 12.0 kept; clean room in a macOS 12 VM via `tart`.** Confirms D8/D9 with the
  tool chosen. (E.)
- **D16 — the clean-room gate is split: portability in the VM, Metal on hardware.** A macOS guest
  reaches Metal through Apple's paravirtualized GPU, which reports reduced capabilities, so ggml
  may pick older kernels or fail to offload there — a VM result says nothing about Metal on a real
  Mac. The tart macOS 12 VM (no Xcode, CLT or Homebrew; quarantined artifact) must prove the dylibs
  load, Gatekeeper passes (the stapled `.pkg` offline) and a **real CPU inference** completes.
  Metal offload is proven separately on physical Apple Silicon, from a fresh user account, with
  the quarantined artifact. Whatever Metal does inside the VM is recorded, not gated. GitHub's macOS
  runners are VMs too, so the D11 CI job is build + mock + static checks, not Metal inference.
  (E3, E4, §13.5.)
- **D17 — C6 is folded into D14.** The cross-OS check is the committed per-row extract of the
  1.2.0 L4 results (Windows + Linux) compared against the Mac on the v2 models. The old v1 slice
  (`evals/parity/c6_cross_os_*`, which exist only on the Mac that produced them) is deleted, and
  `.gitignore` is not widened for it. (C6.)
- **D18 — Time Machine: exclude `~/.knaif/models` only.** `tmutil addexclusion` when a model is
  downloaded — in the `.pkg` postinstall and in `knaif models pull` on Darwin. Models can be
  downloaded again; config and the rest of `~/.knaif` stay in backups. (§12 Q6, F5b.)
- **D19 — the Homebrew formula depends on `ffmpeg` only.** `depends_on "ffmpeg"` (the ffmpeg skill
  needs it); ghostscript, tesseract and LibreOffice go in `caveats`. The model is not downloaded at
  install time — `caveats` says to run `knaif models pull`. (G5.)

- [x] **M4. Skill-dependency tooling via Homebrew** for the eval/quality work: `ffmpeg`,
      `ghostscript`, `libreoffice`, `tesseract`. `deps.rs` already maps macOS → `brew`
      (`deps.rs:45,55,338,343`) — verify the probe actually resolves `/opt/homebrew/bin` entries
      under the PATH a **GUI-launched** process gets, not just a login shell's.

      > there is nothing to test it against; revisit only if a GUI front-end ever lands (ties to D5).
- [x] **M4b. ⚠️ Decide `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` — before A2, not after.** Per D9. Pick the floor
      deliberately, export it before the first functional compile, and use a dedicated
      `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` for release builds so a later change cannot be swallowed by a cached
      `llama-cpp-sys-2` configure (it is **not** a `rerun-if-env-changed` input — verified). Record
      the chosen floor, then have E1 assert `LC_BUILD_VERSION` on every staged Mach-O and E3 launch
      on that oldest OS. A floor that is stated but not asserted is the exact pattern that produced
      both prior portability defects.
      > **Decided 2026-08-03: `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0` (Monterey).** Exported before the very
      > first `llama-cpp-sys-2` configure (A2), so there was no cached-build swallow risk this time.

- [x] **M5. Baseline the repo before changing anything:** `just check` (lint + mypy + pytest +
      generated-docs) and `just test-native`. Record every failure. **Some Python tests have never
      run on Darwin**; a pre-existing failure must not be discovered later and mistaken for

## 4. Workstream A — build the native runtime on macOS

- [x] **A1. Mock build first.** `cargo build --release -p knaif-cli` and `just native-mock -- skills list`.
      No llama.cpp, no C++ — this isolates *knaif's own* Darwin portability from llama.cpp's.
      Expect `cfg(unix)` `libc`/`tcflush` to compile and the `cfg(windows)` console/mutex paths to
      drop out. Fix any `unused_imports` / dead-code warnings that only appear off Windows —
      `check-native` runs clippy with `-D warnings`.
      > **Done 2026-08-03.** Clean build, no warnings, `Finished release profile in 49.85s`.
      > `just native-mock -- skills list` and `skills deps` both work correctly.
- [x] **A2. First functional build.** `cargo build --release -p knaif-cli --features llama`.
      Static, no `dynamic-backends`. This is the smallest thing that can prove Metal works.
      Budget real time for the first llama.cpp compile.
      > **Done 2026-08-03**, with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0` exported per M4b/D9. Compiled in
      > 1m36s wall (9m14s user — genuinely compiled ggml/llama.cpp C++ across all cores, not a
      > cache hit). Much faster than the "budget real time" warning implied on this hardware.
      >
      > **Re-verified 2026-10-02 (M1 Pro, macOS 27.2, Xcode 27.0, Rust 1.96.0): failed, then fixed.**
      > `just package-native metal` stopped before compiling knaif with `E0463 can't find crate for
      > zerofrom_derive` (also `serde_derive`, `thiserror_impl`, `equator_macro`). The dylibs were

      > leaves a proc-macro dylib whose string pool is not 8-byte aligned, and macOS 27's dyld rejects
      > it. Reproduced outside the repo with `serde_derive`: 11.0 loads, 12.0–15.0 fail, with Xcode
      > 27.0, the 27.2 beta and the Command Line Tools alike; an unstripped dylib loads. Fix
      > (`fix(native): keep macOS proc macros unstripped…`):
      > `[profile.release-metal.build-override] strip = "none"`. Proc macros never ship; the shipped
      > `knaif` is stripped as before and runs. Not a D9 change — the floor stays 12.0.
      >
      > **macOS 27.2 Beta 2 (build `26B5091g`), 2026-10-05: dyld fixed.** The same probe outside the
      > repo (`serde_derive`, `strip = "debuginfo"`, `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0`) now builds and
      > loads; on Beta 1 it failed with `E0463`. The build-override stays: it is harmless, and a Mac
      > still on Beta 1 needs it. Xcode 27.0, the CLT and clang were unchanged by the OS update.
      > The merged tree (`bdd01b5`, 1.2.1) builds, packages and passes `check_macho_deps.py`,
      > `check_no_local_paths.py` and `smoke.sh` on Beta 2. **Metal inference is unchanged:** the
      > 1.2.0 binary (`d3e91b27`) on 339 rows — the 1.2.0 sample plus every row that flips between
      > Metal and CUDA — gave the same plan and grade as on Beta 1 for all of them, at the same
      > latency (`evals/runs/2026-10-05_mac-beta2-probe_success`, not committed: boards).
- [x] **A3. Prove Metal is actually selected, not merely compiled.** Run with `--verbose` and
      confirm the device line reports Metal rather than CPU, and that all model layers offload.
      This is the macOS instance of the trap [PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md) §2 documents twice
      (WSL's "Vulkan" runs that were silently CPU; `op_offload` making `n_gpu_layers=0` not
      CPU-only). **A backend that silently isn't the one you think you are benchmarking is the
      single most expensive mistake available here** — establish the check before any timing.
      > **Done 2026-08-03**, against the real `knaif-qwen3-4b-v1` GGUF (downloaded for this purpose).
      > `knaif run ffmpeg "convert input.mov to mp4" --dry-run --verbose` shows
      > `ggml_metal_init: found device: Apple M3 Pro`, `load_tensors: offloaded 37/37 layers to GPU`,
      > every KV-cache layer `dev = MTL0`, and the correct rendered command
      > (`ffmpeg -y -i input.mov -c copy -movflags +faststart input_converted.mp4`). Not silently CPU.
- [x] **A4. `dynamic-backends` build.** `--features llama,dynamic-backends`. Verify the
      `$OUT_DIR/backends/` directory contains `libggml-metal.dylib` plus the three
      `libggml-cpu-apple-*.dylib` variants (§1.1), and that `load_dynamic_backends` registers them.
      Confirm the dev fallback in `backend_dirs()` (`BACKENDS_DIR` baked in at compile time) still
      works for an unstaged `cargo run` and does **not** double-load.
      > **Done 2026-08-03 — with a correction to the plan's own assumption.** `$OUT_DIR/backends/`
      > contains `libggml-metal.so`, `libggml-cpu-apple_m1.so`, `libggml-cpu-apple_m2_m3.so`,
      > `libggml-cpu-apple_m4.so` — **`.so`, not `.dylib`** (see the corrected §1.1 row). Ran the
      > unstaged `cargo run`-equivalent binary against the real GGUF with `--verbose`:
      > `load_backend: loaded MTL backend from …/libggml-metal.so`,
      > `load_backend: loaded CPU backend from …/libggml-cpu-apple_m2_m3.so` (correctly the M2/M3
      > variant, not M1 or M4), each logged **exactly once** (no double-load), then
      > `offloaded 37/37 layers to GPU` — identical outcome to the static A2 build.
- [x] **A5. ⚠️ Establish how dylibs resolve, before touching packaging.** `dynamic-backends`
      implies `dynamic-link`, so `libllama`/`libggml`/`libggml-base`/`libllama-common` become real
      runtime dependencies. `llama-cpp-sys-2`'s `build.rs` emits **no rpath link args at all**
      (verified: no `rustc-link-arg`, no `rpath` anywhere in it) — which is exactly why Linux needs
      `patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN'` in `package.sh`. Determine, with `otool -l`, on both the
      exe and each dylib:
      - each dylib's `LC_ID_DYLIB` install name (CMake's `MACOSX_RPATH` default makes this
        `@rpath/lib….dylib`, but **verify** rather than assume);
      - whether the exe has any `LC_RPATH` at all, and whether `target/release/knaif` even runs
        without `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
      The answer decides B3's shape. **`@loader_path` is macOS's `$ORIGIN`** and is the right choice.
      > **Done 2026-08-03 — every prediction confirmed on hardware.** `otool -L target/release/knaif`
      > shows the four core libs linked as `@rpath/libggml-base.0.dylib`,
      > `@rpath/libggml.0.dylib`, `@rpath/libllama-common.0.dylib`, `@rpath/libllama.0.dylib`, plus
      > only system frameworks (Foundation, Metal, MetalKit, Accelerate, libc++, CoreFoundation,
      > libiconv, libSystem). `otool -D` on each core dylib confirms `LC_ID_DYLIB = @rpath/lib….dylib`
      > exactly as CMake's `MACOSX_RPATH` default predicts. **The exe has zero `LC_RPATH` entries**
      > (`otool -l | grep LC_RPATH` empty), and running it bare fails exactly as predicted:
      > `dyld[…]: Library not loaded: @rpath/libggml-base.0.dylib … Reason: no LC_RPATH's found`
      > (abort, exit 134). With `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/release` set, it runs fine. This confirms
      > B3 must add `-add_rpath @loader_path` to the exe during staging — nothing else will resolve
      > the four core libs in a packaged artifact.
      > *Rationale corrected 2026-08-02 after audit.* The first draft said `@executable_path` is
      > *wrong* "because the backends are `dlopen`ed by a dylib, not by the exe." That reasoning is
      > false — `@executable_path` resolves against the main executable regardless of who does the
      > loading, and in this flat `bin/` layout **both spellings resolve to the same directory and
      > both work.** Prefer `@loader_path` because it keeps each dylib self-contained and correct if
      > the layout is ever nested — a design preference, not a correctness requirement. Note also
      > that the *backend* dylibs are found by an explicit directory scan
      > (`load_backends_from_path`), so the rpath governs their **dependencies** (`libggml-base`
      > and friends), not their own discovery.
- [x] **A6. `knaif-llm` review for Darwin.** `llama.rs`'s `has_backend_libs` normalises a `lib`
      prefix for Linux vs Windows; `.dylib` files also carry the `lib` prefix, so this should hold —
      **confirm with a test**, because the same function silently returned `false` on Linux once and
      caused every backend to load twice. Add a Darwin case to its unit tests.
      > **Done 2026-08-03.** Added `has_backend_libs_recognises_all_platform_namings` to
      > `native/crates/knaif-llm/src/llama.rs` (`#[cfg(feature = "dynamic-backends")]`), covering: an
      > empty dir (false), `libggml-base.{dylib,so}` alone (false — core lib, not a backend),
      > `libggml-metal.so` (true — the **actual** macOS naming per A4's correction),
      > `libggml-vulkan.dylib` (true — extension-agnostic), `libggml-cuda.so` (true — Linux), and
      > `ggml-vulkan.dll` (true — Windows, no `lib` prefix). Passes. The function needed no code
      > change — its prefix-only check was already extension-agnostic and correct.

## 5. Workstream B — packaging (`installers/package.sh`)

`package.sh` already has a `Darwin` arm in its `uname -s` case (`OS=macos; LIB=dylib; ARCHIVE=tgz`)
and `uname -m` returns `arm64`, which passes through its arch mapping unchanged. **Everything else
about macOS in that script is either missing or a Linux/Windows branch that excludes it.** Each item
below names the specific place.

- [x] **B1. `feats_for_kind` + argument parsing: add `metal`, and refuse everything else on Darwin.**
      `--kind=metal` (`llama,dynamic-backends`, minus `openmp` per D3) gets the **plain artifact
      name** on macOS, the way `vulkan` does elsewhere. **Refuse `--kind=cpu|vulkan|cuda` on Darwin
      with a message that says why** — `cpu` because it would be a byte-identical build under a
      misleading name (D2), `vulkan`/`cuda` because neither exists there — rather than failing later
      somewhere unrelated. Mirror the kind list in the `justfile`'s `package-native` recipe and its
      comment block, which hard-codes `cpu|vulkan|cuda`; its own comment says the two must stay in
      sync. Archive format is `.zip` on macOS (D6), which `package.sh` currently selects only for
      Windows — and its Windows branch requires `System32/tar.exe`, so macOS needs its own
      `ditto -c -k --keepParent` or `zip` path.
      > **Done 2026-08-03, with a correction to the plan's own suggestion.** Added `metal` to
      > `feats_for_kind`, arg parsing, and a Darwin refusal block for `cpu`/`vulkan`/`cuda` with a
      > message naming D2/D1 — verified all three refusal messages fire correctly. Mirrored the kind
      > list into the `[unix] package-native` justfile recipe.
      > **`ditto -c -k --keepParent` (the plan's first suggestion) was tried and rejected on hard
      > evidence.** On this build box every staged file already carries a `com.apple.provenance`
      > extended attribute (present the moment `cargo build`/`cp` create a file — not something
      > packaging adds), and `ditto` preserves it as an inline AppleDouble `._<name>` sidecar next to
      > **every** real file — not bundled into one `__MACOSX/` folder — doubling the entry count.
      > Worse: `com.apple.provenance` cannot be stripped first either — `xattr -d`/`xattr -cr` both
      > report success and silently leave it in place (it's a protected, system-managed attribute).
      > Switched to plain `zip -qry` (the plan's other suggested option), which never attempts
      > xattr/resource-fork preservation and produces a clean archive — verified: 0 `._*` entries.
      > This is exactly the kind of macOS-specific hygiene wart E5 warns about (alongside
      > `.DS_Store`); worth remembering for any *other* macOS packaging step that reaches for `ditto`.
- [x] **B2. The build branch excludes macOS.** `package.sh:119` is `elif [ "$OS" = linux ]`, so a
      macOS `--kind=metal` falls into the `else` and prints *"needs the MSVC/C++ toolchain … compile
      it in a VS Developer shell"*. Extend the native-build branch to Darwin (macOS has a real
      compiler on the build box, like Linux and unlike Windows). `CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja` is harmless
      and consistent.
      > **Done 2026-08-03.** `elif [ "$OS" = linux ] || [ "$OS" = macos ]`, with
      > `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="${MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET:-12.0}"` exported before the build per
      > M4b/D9. **Found and fixed a second instance of the same gap**: the `justfile`'s
      > `[unix] package-native` recipe builds directly via `cargo build` (bypassing package.sh's own
      > build step via `--no-build`), so it never got this export either. Confirmed empirically —
      > `otool -l` showed `minos 11.0` (rustc's own default for `aarch64-apple-darwin`, unrelated to
      > llama.cpp's CMake config) on a binary built through that recipe before the fix, `minos 12.0`
      > after. Fixed the recipe the same way; re-verified every staged Mach-O in a rebuilt artifact
      > carries `minos 12.0`, exe and every dylib/`.so` alike.
- [x] **B3. Core-lib staging + install-name surgery.** The staging block is gated
      `linux || windows` (`package.sh:578`) and `set_origin_rpath` is an explicit no-op off Linux
      (its comment already says *"macOS uses `@loader_path`, handled elsewhere"* — this is
      "elsewhere"). Add a Darwin path that stages `libggml-base`/`libggml`/`libllama`/`libllama-common`
      `.dylib`s plus every `libggml-*.dylib` backend, then, per A5's findings, uses
      `install_name_tool` to make the tree relocatable: `-add_rpath @loader_path` on the exe and
      `-id @rpath/<name>` / `-change` on the dylibs as needed. Verify by running the **staged** tree
      from a directory it was not built in.
      > **Done 2026-08-03 — simpler than the plan expected, verified empirically before writing the
      > script.** Added a dedicated macOS staging block (kept separate from the Linux/Windows one
      > rather than threaded into its conditionals, since the extension split — `.dylib` core libs
      > vs `.so` backends per A4 — and the rpath mechanism both differ enough to make a shared block
      > more confusing than two clear ones). Core libs staged via the SONAME-symlink-chain pattern
      > (version embedded before the extension: `libggml-base.dylib` → `.0.dylib` → `.0.13.1.dylib`,
      > unlike Linux's suffix style); backends staged via `$BACKEND_LIB` (`.so`).
      > **`-id`/`-change` install-name surgery on the dylibs turned out to be unnecessary.** Tested
      > directly: staging the four core dylibs as-is (their `LC_ID_DYLIB` already reads
      > `@rpath/lib….dylib` from the build, per A5) and adding **only** `-add_rpath @loader_path` to
      > the **exe** — nothing on the dylibs, nothing on the backend `.so` files — was sufficient.
      > Proved this three ways before committing to it: (1) exe + 4 core dylibs, no backends, run
      > from `/tmp`, no `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` — worked; (2) same plus both backend `.so` files, real
      > Metal inference, external cwd — worked, 37/37 layers offloaded; (3) the actual
      > `package.sh`-produced artifact, unzipped in a fresh temp dir, same real-inference check —
      > worked. dyld resolves every dependent's `@rpath/...` (including the backends' *own*
      > `@rpath/libggml-base....dylib` reference) using the rpath list accumulated from images
      > already loaded in the process — one rpath on the exe covers the whole tree transitively.
- [x] **B4. The `base`-vs-functional guard needs a Darwin probe.** `exe_imports_llama` is
      `patchelf --print-needed` on Linux and a raw `grep -a 'llama.dll'` everywhere else — the
      latter is wrong on macOS. Use `otool -L "$1" | grep -q 'libllama'`. This guard exists because
      cargo overwrites `target/release/knaif` and **`smoke.sh` structurally cannot catch a base exe
      packaged as functional** (`--version`, `skills list`, `skills deps` and a mock `plan` all pass
      without llama); it fails only at a real `run`, in a user's hands.
      > **Done 2026-08-03, with a tightened pattern.** Used `grep -q '/libllama\.'` rather than the
      > plan's suggested bare `libllama` — anchored on "`/libllama` immediately followed by a
      > literal dot" so `libllama-common.*.dylib` (a genuinely different lib whose name happens to
      > share the prefix) can never false-positive the check. Verified against real otool -L output.
- [x] **B5. ⚠️ Resolve the OpenMP question (§1.3) and implement D3's feature split.** `otool -L`
      every staged Mach-O — but judge by **resolution, not path shape**: an unresolvable
      `@rpath/libomp.dylib` is the likely form and carries no Homebrew string. Then implement D3
      properly (`default-features = false` **plus explicit `common`**, a real `openmp` feature
      enabled for the Linux/Windows kinds only) and re-check. **Re-verify the Linux and Windows
      artifacts after that change** — it touches their feature graph too, and `libgomp.so.1` /
      `VCOMP140.dll` staging depends on OpenMP still being on there.
      > **Deliberately deferred 2026-08-03 — not done.** The `otool -L` measurement is already
      > recorded in §1.1's corrected table: on `M3P` (Homebrew present, `libomp` **not** installed),
      > `GGML_OPENMP:BOOL=ON` but `GGML_OPENMP_ENABLED:INTERNAL=OFF` — CMake's `find_package` failed
      > gracefully, zero OpenMP linkage in any built artifact. **Held off on the Cargo.toml feature
      > split itself** (`default-features = false` + explicit `common` + a real `openmp` feature)
      > because it changes the feature graph for **every** platform — including the `just native` /
      > `native-cuda` / `native-vulkan` dev recipes' default `FEATS`, not just `package.sh`'s release

      was missing from every artifact on every OS until 2026-07-26 precisely because nothing read it.
      If D3 lands on staging `libomp.dylib`, its licence joins `licenses/` and
      [PROVENANCE.md](../PROVENANCE.md) gains an entry. `libomp.dylib` is not staged (B5 deferred).

## 6. Workstream C — quality gates

Nothing in this workstream is macOS-specific work; it is **running the gates the other two platforms
already pass, on a third platform, for the first time.**

- [x] **C1. `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
      `cargo test --workspace`** — i.e. `just check-native` + `just test-native`. The llama.cpp
      inference proof is gated on `$KNAIF_TEST_GGUF`; set it so that test actually runs here.
      > **Done 2026-08-07, on M3P.** `cargo fmt --all --check` clean. `cargo clippy --workspace
      > --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean under default features (base, no llama). `cargo test
      > --workspace` (default features): **251 passed, 0 failed** across every crate. The llama
      > module and its `inference_produces_text` test only compile under `--features llama`
      > (`#[cfg(feature = "llama")]` gates the whole module in `knaif-llm/src/lib.rs`) — `just
      > test-native`'s plain invocation never reaches it, matching this task's own note that
      > `$KNAIF_TEST_GGUF` has to be set *and* the feature enabled. Ran both explicitly:
      > `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --features llama,dynamic-backends -- -D warnings`
      > clean, and `KNAIF_TEST_GGUF=<repo>/models/knaif-qwen3-4b-v1-q4_k_m.gguf
      > KNAIF_TEST_NGL=99 cargo test --workspace --features llama,dynamic-backends` — the
      > inference proof passes for real over Metal (37/37 layers offloaded per the test's own
      > `--nocapture` output, output `{"ok": true}` as expected).
- [x] **C2. Full Python suite** — `uv run pytest`. Triage any Darwin-only failure into *this plan's
      bug* vs *a latent cross-platform assumption in a test*. Give particular attention to anything
      touching paths, `~` expansion, case-insensitive filesystems (APFS default!), or `os.name`.
      **Case-insensitivity is the most likely silent difference** and it affects the sandbox path
      validation the safety model depends on.
      > **Done 2026-08-07, on M3P.** `uv run pytest -q`: **1664 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped** on
      > first run. All 7 skips were environment-conditional, not platform-conditional: 1 correctly
      > `sys.platform != "win32"`-skipped Windows-only test, and 6 skipped for missing optional
      > binaries (`tesseract`/`soffice`/`gs`) — the same skips would fire on Linux/Windows without
      > those installed. No case-insensitivity or path-handling failures surfaced. Installed
      > `tesseract` + `ghostscript` via Homebrew (per user's explicit go-ahead; `libreoffice`
      > deliberately skipped as a large, non-blocking download) and re-ran: **1667 passed, 0
      > failed, 4 skipped** — the 3 newly-unskipped tests (OCR + ghostscript-compress paths) all
      > passed on the real binaries, no Darwin-specific defect in either.
- [x] **C3. Contract parity, model-free, first.** Run `contracts/parity/planner_cases.json` on
      macOS. These cases involve no inference, so **any diff is a genuine platform bug** with no
      floating-point excuse available. This is the cheapest possible signal and it must be clean
      before C5 is interpreted at all.
      > **Done 2026-08-07, on M3P.** Both consumers of the fixture pass clean: `cargo test
      > --workspace --test parity` (`knaif-core`'s `planner_parity_cases`, the Rust deterministic
      > pipeline) — 1 passed; and `uv run pytest python/core/tests/test_planner_parity.py` (the
      > Python side) — 1 passed. No inference involved in either, so this is a clean go-ahead for
      > interpreting C5.
- [x] **C0. ⚠️ PREREQUISITE, and it is not macOS work: the regression gate currently proves
      nothing.** *Added 2026-08-02 after audit; every claim below re-verified against the code.*
      **DISCHARGED 2026-08-04** — all four defects closed, acceptance criterion 0 met. Defects 1–2
      fixed 2026-08-03; defect 4 (both snapshots re-locked with executing verifiers) and the
      verifier-selection defect that surfaced underneath it, 2026-08-04. See the closing note under
      this task.
      The first draft wrote `just eval-success <skill>` → `just eval-regression <skill>` and called
      it a gate. It is not one. Four independent defects, any one of which is sufficient:

      1. **`regression` compares the snapshot to itself and always passes.**
         `cmd_regression` sets `current: dict[str, Any] = baseline  # default: compare snapshot to
         itself (no-op)` ([`cli.py`](../../python/core/knaif/evalsuite/cli.py) ~line 1077) and only
         overrides it when `--current FILE` is given.
      2. **`just eval-regression skill:` takes no pass-through args** ([`justfile`](../../justfile)
         ~line 534), so the recipe *cannot* supply `--current` even though the CLI accepts it.
      3. **`just eval-success` persists nothing without `--save`** — the scoreboard is only written
         under `if args.save:` — so there is no current file to pass in the first place.
      4. **Neither snapshot matches its corpus, and one has the wrong verifier.** Measured
         2026-08-02:

         | Skill | Snapshot verifier | Bar (utterances) | Corpus records | Corpus utterances | Drift |
         |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
         | `ffmpeg` | **`cheap`** ⚠️ | 297 | 314 | **847** | **+550** |
         | `documents` | `success` | 129 | 143 | **164** | **+35** |

         > **The +17/+14 figures published here on 2026-08-02 were wrong** — corrected 2026-08-04
         > against a real run. A snapshot's `total` counts **utterances**, and every `eval.jsonl`
         > record carries an `utterances` LIST, so the audit was comparing utterances against the
         > file's line count. The audit's conclusion holds and gets stronger: ffmpeg's bar covered
         > **35%** of its corpus, not 95%.

         `ffmpeg`'s bar is a **`cheap`** snapshot, which [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and
         [EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md](../EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md) both state is an iteration instrument and never
         an acceptance bar — *"a `cheap` snapshot reports false regressions when the corpus is
         annotated."* **The audit flagged `ffmpeg` only; `documents` is stale too**, by 14 rows.

      Also: `--config` defaults to `eval_backends.yaml` and `_resolve_backends` returns **every**
      stanza when `--backends` is omitted, so `just eval-success ffmpeg` tries to run models whose
      GGUFs [PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md) §8 records as *deliberately absent* — each scoring
      ~0.0 and looking like catastrophic quality loss.

      **This is a pre-existing repository defect, not something macOS introduced**, and it must be
      fixed independently and first — otherwise this plan's acceptance criterion 6 is a gate that
      cannot fail. Minimum fix: re-lock both snapshots with an **executing** verifier against the
      current corpora on a known-good platform (its own commit, per the standing rule), and teach
      `just eval-regression` to forward `*args` so `--current` is reachable.

      > **Defects 2 and part of 1 fixed 2026-08-03; defects 3 and 4 (snapshot re-locking)
      > deliberately NOT attempted.** Fixed the two purely-mechanical, zero-risk pieces:
      > - `just eval-regression skill:` → `eval-regression skill *args:`, forwarding `{{args}}` —
      >   `--current` is now actually reachable through the recipe (defect 2).
      > - `cmd_regression` now (a) prints a loud `⚠` warning to stderr when `--current` is omitted,
      >   instead of silently reporting "No regressions... OK" indistinguishably from a real check,
      >   and (b) **hard-fails** when `--current` is given but the file doesn't exist, instead of
      >   silently falling back to the self-compare — a mistyped path used to look exactly like a
      >   passing gate. Both verified directly (warning fires + exit 0 on no-arg; hard error + exit 1
      >   on a bad path). No existing test exercised `cmd_regression` at all, so nothing to break;
      >   full `uv run pytest python/core/tests/` still 1629 passed after the change (see M5).
      >
      > **Left undone, deliberately:** re-locking either snapshot (defect 4) needs a real,

      > re-locked) therefore still does **not** hold; criterion 6 still cannot be honestly claimed.

- [ ] **C4. The eval ladder for both shipped skills** *(C0 was discharged by 1.2.0's re-locked snapshots)*. `just eval-fixtures <skill>`
      — **always first**, since missing fixtures score correct plans ~0 — then run each snapshot's
      **exact** verifier against a single pinned production backend and **save** the scoreboard, then
      diff it explicitly:

      ```bash
      just eval-fixtures ffmpeg
      uv run -m knaif.evalsuite run --skill ffmpeg --verifier success \
        --backends <production-backend> --save evals/runs/2026-XX-XX_macos-ffmpeg_success
      uv run -m knaif.evalsuite regression --skill ffmpeg \
        --current evals/runs/2026-XX-XX_macos-ffmpeg_success/ffmpeg_<backend>_success.json
      ```

      `--backends` is not optional (see C0), the verifier must match the snapshot's own, and the
      `--current` path is what makes the comparison real. Add a row to `evals/INDEX.md` per run.
      Gate against the **committed** snapshots — do **not** re-lock one on macOS. Re-locking moves
      the acceptance bar and is a deliberate, own-commit act; a platform port is never the reason to
      move it.

      `plan --json` output against the same slice from a Windows or Linux build. Distinct from C5,
      which compares two runtimes on one machine. This is the check that says "the same request

## 7. Workstream D — performance measurement

The deliverable is **rows in [PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md)**, produced with the same
methodology as the existing ones so they are comparable: Qwen3-4B q4_k_m, the ffmpeg skill prompt
(3938 tokens), 32-token generation, `n_ctx = 8192`, fresh process, median of warm reps,
`KNAIF_TIMING=1`.

- [x] **D1. Per-phase Metal numbers.** model load, `new_context`, prompt decode, generation,
      teardown, wall. Add a `macos` row to §2's backend table and a machine row to §1.
      > **Done 2026-10-03 on `M1P`** (M1 Pro, 16-core GPU, 16 GB, **macOS 27.2 Beta 1**; machine row in
      > PERFORMANCE §1, table in §2). The packaged metal zip, median of 5 warm runs, `MTL0` 37/37:
      > 4B load 346 ms, `new_context` ~118 ms, prompt 4824 ms (506 tok/s), generation 1894 ms
      > (16.9 tok/s), inference 6843 ms, wall 7.35 s; 1.7B 1932 ms (1263 tok/s) / 856 ms
      > (37.4 tok/s) / 2886 ms / 3.29 s. Teardown is not timed separately: wall minus inference minus
      > load is ~0.15 s for process start, rendering and exit together.
- [x] **D2. An honest CPU comparison — from a tree with no Metal backend in it.** ⚠️ Read
      [PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md) §4 **first**: with any GPU backend compiled in,
      `n_gpu_layers=0` is *not* CPU-only — `op_offload` still sends batched matmuls to the GPU, an
      11× difference on the measurement that matters. **`KNAIF_N_GPU_LAYERS=0` is therefore not a
      valid method here.** Use D2's mechanism from the decision log: copy the staged tree, delete
      `libggml-metal.dylib`, and measure that. The loader then has no Metal backend to find, which
      is a structural guarantee rather than a runtime request. Produce an honest CPU number or
      produce none; a dishonest one has already invalidated a draft of that document once.
      > **Done 2026-10-03 on `M1P`**, by exactly that mechanism (the backend is `libggml-metal.so` in
      > the staged tree; `load_backend` then loads only `libggml-cpu-apple_m1.so`). 4B, median of 3:
      > load 4003 ms, prompt 25 888 ms (94 tok/s), generation 4935 ms (6.5 tok/s), inference
      > 30 940 ms. Metal is 5.4× on prompt, 2.6× on generation, ~4.5× end to end.
- [ ] **D3. ⚠️ The first-run shader tax — measure it, and do NOT plan to fix it at install time.**
      Vulkan's first-ever run cost **38.3 s** of pipeline compilation vs 2.1 s warm (§2), and *the
      first launch after install looks hung*. macOS is structurally similar-but-different: the Metal
      library is embedded as **source**, compiled by the Metal runtime, with an OS-level shader
      cache underneath.

      **Measurement:** a fresh VM snapshot or a fresh user account. *Not* by clearing system Metal
      caches — that is neither a supported operation nor a reproducible one, and a benchmark whose
      setup step is unsupported is a benchmark nobody can repeat.

      **⚠️ Remedy, corrected 2026-08-02 after audit.** The first draft proposed "warm at install
      time", copying §2's prescription for Vulkan. **That does not work for this product**, for
      three independent reasons: the `.zip` has no installer at all; `.pkg` scripts run **as root**,
      so they would warm root's cache and not the user's; and the GGUF is downloaded *later* — on
      first `run` — so at install time there is usually no model to warm against. The viable options
      are:
      - **warm during the first user-owned `models pull` / `run`**, with explicit progress, so the
        cost is attached to something the user already knows is slow; or
      - **move compilation to build time** by setting `GGML_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY=OFF` and staging +
        signing the resulting `default.metallib`. This trades the runtime tax for a packaging step,
        an extra signed file, and possibly a **full-Xcode** build prerequisite (the `else` branch of
        `ggml-metal/CMakeLists.txt` invokes `xcrun -sdk macosx metal`), which would change M3's
        answer. Measure the tax before paying either price.

      > **Measured 2026-10-09 (M1 Pro, macOS 27.2, the signed 1.2.1 `.zip`, 4B v2):** a new
      > standard user, the `.zip` quarantined and extracted by Finder, `knaif run documents --yes
      > "rotate sample.pdf 90 degrees"` twice. **Cold 18.93 s, warm 3.40 s** wall time, 37/37 on
      > `MTL0` both times — a ~15.5 s first-run tax, against Vulkan's 38.3 s. It bundles the Metal
      > shader compile with the first quarantined launch's online notarization check; the model was
      > most likely already in the file cache. One machine, one account: no remedy chosen yet.
- [ ] **D4. Unified-memory behaviour.** Apple Silicon shares one memory pool, so "VRAM" is a
      soft, OS-capped fraction (`iogpu.wired_limit_pct`). Test the recommended 4B model on the
      lowest memory configuration reachable and note where it stops fitting. If 8 GB Macs cannot
      hold 4B comfortably, that is a **model-recommendation** decision, not a bug — the manifest
      already carries `knaif-qwen3-1.7b-v1` (1.32 GB, ~2× faster, ~2.4pt behind on ffmpeg per §5) for
      exactly this situation. Record the finding; do not silently change the default.
      > **Partial 2026-10-03:** on the 16 GB `M1P` the 4B fits with room to spare — 2376 MB of
      > weights and a 302 MB compute buffer on `MTL0` against Metal's 12 713 MB working-set cap.
      > No 8 GB Mac was reachable, so where it stops fitting is still open.
- [ ] **D5. Feed the OpenMP decision (D3 in §2).** If `GGML_OPENMP=OFF` is the chosen fix, measure
      the CPU-fallback path with and without it, so the trade is recorded rather than asserted.
      > **Open.** D2's CPU number (2026-10-03) is the no-OpenMP build that ships; the with-OpenMP
      > side needs a separate build with Homebrew's libomp and was not made.
- [x] **D6. Update the reproduction section** ([PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md) §9) with the
      macOS commands, and add any macOS entry to §7 *Environment gotchas*.
      > **Done 2026-10-03:** §9 has the macOS commands (packaged zip, Metal-less copy, placement
      > check); §7 entry 5 covers the symlinked `models/` folder and the checkout-outside-`~` rule.

## 8. Workstream E — portability verification (the part that is not optional)

> **The rule this workstream implements, quoted from [RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) §4:
> a verification step that runs on the build box tests STAGING, never PORTABILITY** — and that
> document already names macOS as a new artifact shape requiring its own clean-room run before
> publication.

- [x] **E1. `scripts/check_macho_deps.py` — the third sibling.** Written to match
      `check_pe_imports.py` and `check_elf_deps.py`: **parse the Mach-O headers in pure Python** so
      it runs on any machine, including the Windows dev box, and therefore **fails where the mistake
      was made** rather than on a user's Mac. It must:
      - read **every** dependency load command, not just the obvious two:
        `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`, `LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB`,
        `LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB`, plus `LC_RPATH` and `LC_ID_DYLIB`;
      - **assert resolution, not path shape** (§1.3): every dependency must resolve to a file staged
        in the same directory via `@rpath`/`@loader_path`, or to a genuine system path
        (`/usr/lib/**`, `/System/Library/Frameworks/**`). An **unresolvable** `@rpath/libomp.dylib`
        must fail exactly as loudly as a visible `/opt/homebrew/...` — that is the whole point;
      - walk **every architecture slice** of a fat binary, reject any non-`arm64` slice (D4), and
        assert `LC_BUILD_VERSION` matches the declared deployment floor (D9);
      - ship with **malformed and mutated Mach-O fixtures**, so the checker is verified to catch
        what it claims to. `test_installer_iss.py` set this precedent — a lint verified by injecting
        all 14 mutations it claims to catch — and a checker nobody has seen fail is a checker nobody
        should trust.

      Wire it into `package.sh` as a **required** macOS step, the way the PE check is required on
      Windows — not merely into `smoke.sh`, because packaging is the only step every artifact passes
      through by construction.
      > **Done 2026-08-03 — and it immediately caught a real, previously-shipped defect.** Wrote
      > `scripts/check_macho_deps.py` (pure `struct` parsing, no `otool`/`lipo` shell-out, same
      > shape as the two siblings) covering every point above, plus one the plan didn't ask for: if
      > any dependency uses `@rpath`, the checker requires the file's own `LC_RPATH` to include
      > `@loader_path`/`@executable_path` — directly encoding A5's finding that the default build
      > has ZERO rpath entries, rather than only catching it indirectly via a failed resolution.
      >
      > **Ran it against the real artifact from B3/B6 (already "verified working" by real
      > inference) and it failed**: `libllama-common.dylib` linked

- [x] **E2 (first bullet only). `installers/smoke.sh` on macOS.** Most of it works already: `bin/knaif`
      discovery, the LICENSE/NOTICE and three-contracts assertions, and `backend list` resolving the

      - extend check 7 — currently gated `uname -s != Linux && -f bin/knaif.exe`, so it silently
        skips on Darwin — to call `check_macho_deps.py`;
      - **`.zip` is already handled** (via `unzip`), so D6's archive needs nothing new — but
        **`.pkg` is not**, and cannot be: `smoke.sh`'s dispatch covers zip / tar.gz / AppImage /

      Per D8 and D9. A VM (Virtualization.framework via `tart`, UTM, or equivalent) with **no Xcode,
      no Command Line Tools and no Homebrew**, running the **minimum** OS the deployment floor
      claims — a clean *current* macOS tests the toolchain assumption but says nothing about the
      floor. Assert `--version`, `skills list` (exe-relative), and an offline mock `plan --json` —
      **and then, decisively, a real local GGUF `run`.**
      > **Why the real run is not optional.** `--version`, `skills list`, `skills deps` and a mock

- [ ] **E4. Gatekeeper behaviour, simulated honestly — including extraction semantics.** `curl` does
      **not** set the quarantine attribute; Safari and Finder do, and they **propagate** it to
      extracted contents. So neither a `curl` download nor `xattr`-ing an archive and unpacking it
      with command-line `tar`/`unzip` reproduces what a user experiences. Test at least one of:
      a genuine browser download extracted in Finder, or an explicit **recursive** quarantine
      applied to the extracted tree. **Run it before signing (expect a block) and after (expect a
      clean launch)**, so the signing work is demonstrated to have changed something rather than
      assumed to have — and test the stapled `.pkg` **with networking disabled**, since offline is
      the only condition that distinguishes a stapled ticket from an online lookup (D6).

- [ ] **E6. `.pkg` verification — two gates `smoke.sh` structurally cannot provide.**
      *Added 2026-08-02 after audit.*
      - **Static inspection:** `pkgutil --expand` the package and check payload contents, install
        location, file ownership and modes, the receipt's identifier and version (D7), the
        Installer signature, and that `LICENSE`/`NOTICE` are inside it.
      - **Disposable-VM installation:** install the **final stapled** package, run real inference
        offline, verify Metal selection and layer offload, then exercise **upgrade over an existing
        install** and the documented uninstall. [RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) §4 already records why
        upgrade is its own gate: on Windows, two installer directives only ever execute on an
        upgrade, so a fresh install proves nothing about them.

## 9. Workstream F — code signing and notarization

An Apple Developer account is available (recorded in the current
[`installers/macos/README.md`](../../installers/macos/README.md) placeholder). Two certificates are
needed: **Developer ID Application** (binaries and dylibs) and **Developer ID Installer** (the
`.pkg`).

- [x] **F1. Certificates and credentials.** The owner obtains both certs and the notarization
      key by [macos-signing-certificates](2026-09-30-macos-signing-certificates.md) (Account Holder only; no Mac needed). The contributor then imports them. Store notarization
      credentials in the keychain with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials` (App Store Connect API
      key preferred over an app-specific password — it is revocable and scoped). **No secret enters
      the repository**, and the profile name used by scripts is a documented input, not a hard-coded
      value.
      > **Done 2026-10-06.** The owner's Developer ID Application and Developer ID Installer identities
      > (team `8YJ4KKV9SJ`) are in the Mac's login keychain, and the notary credentials are a keychain
      > profile / environment input of `notarize.sh`; nothing secret is in the repository. They signed,
      > notarized and stapled the first build (step 9): both submissions **Accepted** with no issues
      > (`evals/runs/2026-10-06_mac-signing-first_notary/`, which keeps `dist/notary/`).
      > **That build is not releasable:** it was made in a checkout under `~`, so `knaif` and
      > `libggml` carry one home-directory path each, and `release.sh` does not re-run the path guard
      > before signing. The release build is to be made again outside `~` and signed again.
- [ ] **F2. ⚠️ Order of operations — and it is a DAG with two branches, not one line.** *Revised
      2026-08-02 after audit.* Any modification to a Mach-O invalidates its signature, and
      `install_name_tool` (B3) and `strip` are modifications. **Stapling also mutates the `.pkg`**,
      which is why checksums come last:

      ```text
      stage
        → install-name / rpath surgery + strip
        → sign every Mach-O
        → verify every Mach-O
        ├─ build final .zip  → notarytool submit → read the log        (cannot be stapled — D6)
        └─ pkgbuild/productbuild + Installer-sign
                             → notarytool submit → read the log → stapler staple → stapler validate
        → clean-room tests (E3, E4, E6)
        → SHA256SUMS over the final files
      ```

      Encode it in a script so it cannot be got wrong by hand. **Generate `SHA256SUMS` only after
      stapling** — a checksum taken before it describes a file that no longer exists, which is the
      same class of error as `just installer` overwriting a published setup.exe
      ([RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) §4).

- [ ] **F3. Sign inside-out with the hardened runtime, and verify per-binary.** Every `.dylib`
      first, the exe last, `--options runtime --timestamp --sign "Developer ID Application: …"`.
      **Do not lean on `codesign --deep` over the tree** — `--deep` is a bundle-oriented convenience
      that Apple explicitly discourages for signing and that reads poorly over a flat `bin/` of
      loose Mach-Os. Iterate over every actual Mach-O and assert, per file: valid signature, the
      expected **Team ID**, hardened runtime enabled, and a secure timestamp present. E1 already
      enumerates the files; reuse that list so the two checks cannot disagree about what is in the
      artifact.

- [ ] **F3b. Read the notarization log even on success.** *Added 2026-08-02 after audit.*
      `xcrun notarytool log <submission-id>` after an `Accepted` result — Apple's own guidance is to
      review it, because a submission can be accepted while carrying warnings (an unsigned nested
      binary, a missing secure timestamp) that become failures on a later OS or a later policy
      change. Confirm the log lists **every** Mach-O's CDHash: that is the only direct evidence the
      archive's nested binaries were covered, and it matters most for the `.zip` branch, whose
      contents cannot be stapled and are therefore verified online per-binary.
      >
      > Written on Windows 2026-09-30, tested there and on Linux against faked Apple tools; **not
      > yet run on a Mac.** `notarize.sh` saves every log to `dist/notary/` and

- [ ] **F4. ⚠️ Determine the minimum entitlements empirically — start with none.** Two are
      plausibly required and both weaken the hardened runtime, so neither is added speculatively:
      - `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` — Metal compiles the embedded shader source at runtime.
        Metal's compilation normally happens in a system XPC service rather than in-process, so
        this may well be unnecessary. **Test with no entitlements first**, under the hardened
        runtime, on the clean-room VM.
      - `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` — needed only to `dlopen` a dylib signed
        by a *different* Team ID. Our own backends are signed by us, so this should not be needed —
        and its absence is a *feature*: a user dropping an unsigned dylib into `~/.knaif/backends`
        being refused is correct behaviour on macOS, not a defect. Add it only if a real,
        reproduced failure demands it, and record the failure in the plan if so.
      > **No entitlements needed on the Mac, 2026-10-06** (step 9, `just release-macos` with none). The
      > signed `knaif`, hardened runtime, no entitlements: `codesign --verify --strict --deep` passes;

- [ ] **F5. The `.pkg`, specified rather than gestured at.** `pkgbuild` (payload + install location
      + identifier + `--version` **derived from `package.sh`'s `VER`**, D7) → `productbuild`
      (distribution + Developer ID Installer signature). Decide and document, because each is
      user-visible and none has a safe default:
      - **package identifier** and install location. Suggested: payload under `/usr/local/knaif`.
      - **receipt and version behaviour on upgrade** — verified by E6, not assumed.
      - **file ownership and modes** in the payload.
      - **uninstall.** ⚠️ **macOS packages have no native uninstall action**, so "uninstall" is
        *documentation* — the commands to remove the install root, the `~/.knaif` data directory
        (D5), and `pkgutil --forget`. Say so plainly in the release body rather than leaving users
        to discover it; the Linux tarball's entry in [RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) §6 sets the
        precedent for stating this.
      - **PATH.** *Reconsidered 2026-08-02 after audit.* The first draft wanted to mirror the
        Windows installer's opt-in PATH consent. The analogy is weaker than it looked: on Windows
        the choice is *edit the user's `PATH` environment variable* (a persistent, global mutation),
        whereas here it is a symlink in a directory that is already on the default `PATH` — and
        **running the installer is itself consent to install the CLI**. Making it a checkbox
        requires a multi-component Distribution package for little benefit. Default to placing the
        symlink and documenting it; revisit only if the simple form proves objectionable.
      > **Superseded 2026-09-30 by D13.** The owner chose the Windows-like options page after all:
      > a Distribution package with `customize="always"`, the PATH symlink as one of its choices,
      > payload in `/usr/local/knaif`, and an `uninstall.sh` shipped with it.
      >
      > **Decided and implemented 2026-09-30 (Windows), per D13 — first run on a Mac pending:** package
      > identifiers `tech.blackdeep.knaif.{core,skill.<name>,path,tool.<name>,model}`; payload in
      > `/usr/local/knaif`, `--ownership recommended` (root:wheel), modes `u+rwX,go+rX,go-w`; the core
      > preinstall clears `bin/ skills/ contracts/ licenses/` so an upgrade drops removed files (the
      > Windows installer's [InstallDelete]); `/usr/local/knaif/uninstall.sh` removes the install, the link
      > if it is ours, and the receipts, with `--purge` for `~/.knaif`. Tool and model scripts run as the
      > console user and always exit 0. `installers/macos/build-pkg.sh`, `just package-pkg`.
      >
      > **The PATH link's precondition, 2026-10-03 (M1 Pro, macOS 27.2): passed.** A `knaif` reached
      > through a symlink finds its real folder. `just package-native metal` from a checkout outside
      > `~`, then the staged `bin/knaif` symlinked into an unrelated folder and run from there:
      > `skills list` lists `documents` and `ffmpeg` (both native); `run documents --verbose` loads
      > `libggml-metal.so` and `libggml-cpu-apple_m1.so` from the real `bin/`, not the link's folder,
      > reports `found device: Apple M1 Pro` and `offloaded 37/37 layers to GPU` with every KV-cache
      > layer on `MTL0` (`knaif-qwen3-4b-v2`). "extract the text from report.pdf" through the link
      > executed and printed the page. One request ("how many pages does report.pdf have") came back
      > as a `clarify`: the model proposed an `output_key` argument no documents tool has, and
      > validation refused it. The real path gives the same answer, so it is the model, not the link.

- [x] **F5b. Exclude the model store from Time Machine (D18).** `tmutil addexclusion
      ~/.knaif/models` (run as the console user) in the `.pkg` postinstall and in `knaif models pull`
      on Darwin; a failure to exclude is reported, never fatal. Verify with `tmutil isexcluded`.
      >
      > **Done in code 2026-09-30 (Windows):** `ModelStore::exclude_from_backups` after every download
      > (`models pull` and the first-run offer), default store only, failures reported with the manual
      > command. Verify on the Mac: `tmutil isexcluded ~/.knaif/models`.
      >
      > **Verified 2026-10-03** after installing the `.pkg` (E6): `tmutil isexcluded ~/.knaif/models`
      > → `[Excluded]`. Not proof that the postinstall set it: an earlier `knaif models pull` on this
      > Mac may have. A fresh account (the E3/E4 room) would separate the two.

- [ ] **F6. Notarize and staple — the two branches of F2's DAG.** `xcrun notarytool submit --wait`
      on the `.pkg` **and** on the `.zip` (D6 makes the `.zip` both the notarized and the published
      container, so there is no longer a mismatch to reason about), then `xcrun stapler staple` the
      `.pkg` and `xcrun stapler validate` it. Read both logs (F3b).
      > **State the archive's limitation in the release body rather than papering over it:** a
      > ticket cannot be stapled to a `.zip`, so a quarantined archive's first run needs Apple's
      > service reachable. That is the whole reason the `.pkg` exists (D6) — tell users which to
      > pick and why, the way §6 already does for SmartScreen and the AppImage's FUSE requirement.
      >
      > Written on Windows 2026-09-30, tested there and on Linux against faked Apple tools; **not
      > yet run on a Mac.** `notarize.sh` notarizes either file and staples and validates a `.pkg`;
      > credentials from `KNAIF_NOTARY_PROFILE` (by hand) or the API-key trio (CI).
      >
      > **Ran 2026-10-06:** the `.zip` notarized (cannot be stapled, as designed) and the `.pkg`
      > notarized, stapled and validated (`The staple and validate action worked!`). To tick on the
      > clean release build.

- [ ] **F7. Verify the way Gatekeeper does, not the way the signer does.** *Corrected 2026-08-02
      after audit.* For **bare command-line binaries** use
      `codesign -R="notarized" --check-notarization -vv <binary>`; `spctl --type exec` is the legacy
      *app-bundle* check and is not the right instrument for a CLI (`spctl -a -vvv -t install`
      remains correct for the `.pkg`). **The decisive test is neither** — it is E4's quarantined
      launch in the clean-room VM, offline for the stapled `.pkg`. Tooling reports what a policy
      engine *would* say; the quarantined run reports what it *does* say.
      >
      > Written on Windows 2026-09-30, tested there and on Linux against faked Apple tools; **not
      > yet run on a Mac.** `release.sh`'s last step runs `codesign -R=notarized
      > --check-notarization` on the exe and `spctl -a -t install` on the `.pkg`.
      >
      > **Ran 2026-10-06:** `codesign -R=notarized --check-notarization` on `knaif` (valid, Designated
      > Requirement satisfied) and `spctl -a -t install` on the `.pkg` (`accepted`, `source=Notarized
      > Developer ID`). The decisive check is still the quarantined launch in the clean room (E4).

- [x] **F8. Cross-link [code-signing](2026-07-27-code-signing.md).** That plan covers Windows
      signing and is deferred pending release history. macOS signing is **not** deferred — it is
      not optional the way Windows signing is (SmartScreen is a warning; Gatekeeper is a block) —
      but both plans should point at each other so the certificate/HSM story is designed once.
      >
      > **Done 2026-09-30:** the code-signing plan's out-of-scope line now points here and at the
      > certificates plan, and says to reuse this plan's CI-signing pattern for Windows.

## 10. Workstream G — release integration and documentation

- [ ] **G1. `docs/RELEASE.md`.** Add macOS to the artifact table (§1), a build-and-package section
      (§2) alongside Linux and Windows, the signing/notarization sequence, the macOS clean-room and
      static-check rows in §4, and macOS notes in §6 (Gatekeeper, `xattr`, `.pkg` vs `.zip`,
      Intel unsupported, `brew` for external tools, uninstall/`~/.knaif` removal).
      >
      > **Drafted 2026-09-30 (Windows):** §1 artifact rows, §2 *macOS* build and sign, §4 static check and
      > clean room, checksums after stapling, §5 tag upload and step 9 (Homebrew tap), §6 user notes. Check
      > each against what actually happens on the Mac.

- [ ] **G2. `docs/NATIVE.md`.** §5.3's build-kind table gains `metal`; §5.5's backend
      recommendation gains a macOS line; §9's packaging section gains the macOS layout; §10 gains
      the build commands; **§12's "macOS — no installers/notarization; explicitly out for v1" line
      is deleted**, which is the single clearest signal that this plan landed.
      >
      > **Partly done 2026-09-30:** §5.3 gains the `metal` row. The §12 line is deleted only when this
      > plan lands; §5.5 and §9/§10 wait for the Mac's measured facts.

- [ ] **G3. `installers/macos/README.md`.** Replace the placeholder with the real thing. Its current
      content is a promissory note and its predictions should be checked against what actually
      happened — in particular it says "universal2 if feasible, else per-arch", which D4 answers.
      >
      > **Drafted 2026-09-30 (Windows):** the placeholder is replaced; the file says which steps have not
      > run on a Mac yet. Update it as they do.

- [ ] **G4. The rest.** `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` (Workstream D), `docs/INFERENCE.md` (§ macOS rows are
      Python-side and already partly correct — reconcile), `docs/PROVENANCE.md` (only if D3 lands on
      staging libomp), `docs/MODELS.md` (only if D4 changes a recommendation), `README.md` platform
      support, `evals/INDEX.md` rows, `docs/TODO.md` and `docs/plans/README.md` entries. Run
      `just licenses-all` before any release cut, per the existing rule.
- [ ] **G5. Homebrew tap — in 1.3.0 (D12), no longer a fast-follow.** The owner creates the
      repository. **Formula shape (D19):** `depends_on "ffmpeg"`; ghostscript, tesseract and
      LibreOffice in `caveats`; the model is not downloaded at install — `caveats` says to run
      `knaif models pull`. A
      `blackdeep-tech/homebrew-knaif` tap with a formula pointing at the published `.zip` and its
      `SHA256SUMS` entry. `brew install blackdeep-tech/knaif/knaif` is what a macOS CLI user expects
      and it sidesteps the quarantine question entirely. Depends on G1's published artifact.
      >
      > Written on Windows 2026-09-30, tested there and on Linux against faked Apple tools; **not
      > yet run on a Mac.** `homebrew/knaif.rb.in` + `render-formula.sh`; `test_macos_release.py`
      > checks the formula depends on exactly the required tools and lists the optional ones in the
      > caveats. **Watch the first install:** Homebrew's relocation may rewrite the dylibs' install
      > names and re-sign them ad hoc, dropping the Developer ID signature from the installed copy.
      > If it does, record it here; a cask is the fallback shape.

- [ ] **G6. Hand off to CI.** [post-v1-ci-and-cuda-opt-in](2026-07-17-post-v1-ci-and-cuda-opt-in.md)
      explicitly parks macOS out of its C3 matrix *"until macOS packaging lands"*. When this plan
      closes, that condition is met: add `macos-14`/`macos-15` (arm64) runners to the matrix and note
      that signing and notarization need repository secrets, which is why they cannot simply be
      lifted into CI on day one.
      > **2026-09-30 (D10, D11):** the macOS CI job is path-filtered, and signing/notarization move
      > into the tag workflow **once the hand-signed first build works** — from the secrets on the
      > protected `release` environment.
      >
      > **Done in workflow 2026-09-30 (Windows), not yet run:** `ci.yml` job `macos` (macos-14,
      > path-filtered per D11): Darwin tests, the metal package, smoke, an unsigned `.pkg` inspected, the
      > installer tests under bash 3.2 — no Metal inference (D16). `release.yml` job `macos`: tag only,
      > `environment: release`, off until the variable `MACOS_SIGNING=enabled`; imports the identities into
      > a throwaway keychain and runs `just release-macos`. The owner creates the environment, the
      > secrets (names as in the certificates plan) and the variable.
      >
      > **2026-10-03:** both macOS jobs moved from `macos-14` to `macos-15`. The first CI runs (PR #77)
      > failed in `just package-native metal`: Xcode 15.4's clang cannot compile llama.cpp's `apple_m4`
      > CPU variant (SVE intrinsics under `-march=armv9.2-a+...+nosve+sme`). The 12.0 deployment target
      > is unchanged.

---

## 11. Out of scope

- **Intel Macs (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) and universal2 binaries** — D4.
- **A macOS GUI / menu-bar app.** The engine crates were designed to be embeddable by one
  ([NATIVE.md](../NATIVE.md) §1); building one is a product, not a port.
- **iOS / iPadOS.** `llama-cpp-sys-2` has an `AppleVariant::Other` arm and a Metal backend, so it is
  reachable in principle — and it is a different product with a different distribution model.
- **The persistent daemon and prompt-prefix KV reuse.** Tracked in
  [TODO.md](../TODO.md) *Open / Next* for 1.2.0, cross-platform, and independent of this work.
- **Re-locking any eval snapshot** — C4.
- **Changing the recommended model.** D4 may produce a *finding* about 8 GB Macs; acting on it is a
  separate, deliberate decision.

---

## 12. Open questions to resolve during execution

1. ~~Does the stock toolchain link Homebrew's `libomp`?~~ **Resolved 2026-08-07 (B5):** not by
   default, but yes once the build environment resolves the keg-only formula (e.g.
   `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` pointing at it) — and D3's fix (an explicit, opt-in `openmp` feature, off
   on macOS) is implemented and verified to hold under that exact environment.
2. ~~What is the deployment floor?~~ **Promoted to decision D9 + task M4b** (2026-08-02) — it is a
   release gate, not a question to answer later. *Which* version to pick remains open; whether it is
   chosen deliberately does not.
3. **Command Line Tools or full Xcode?** (M3.) *A CLT-only tart VM answers it — provision one
   alongside E3's clean room.* Materially changes the contributor prerequisite —
   and D3's build-time-`metallib` fallback would likely force full Xcode, so the two are linked.
4. **Does the hardened runtime need `allow-jit` for Metal shader compilation?** (F4.)
5. **How large is the first-run Metal shader-compilation tax?** (D3.) Decides whether an
   install-time warm-up is needed — and if it is, whether the same mechanism should finally be built
   for Vulkan, where §2 has flagged it as an open item since 2026-07-14.
6. ~~Does `~/.knaif` need a Time Machine / iCloud exclusion?~~ **Decided 2026-09-30 (D18, F5b):**
   exclude `~/.knaif/models` only, via `tmutil addexclusion`.

---

## 13. Acceptance criteria

macOS support is done when **all** of the following hold. *Revised 2026-08-02 after audit — three of
these were previously unfalsifiable.*

0. **C0 is discharged** — by 1.2.0's re-locked snapshots (the 2026-09-30 sync), not by macOS work.
   `just eval-regression` receives an explicit `--current` scoreboard.
1. `just check` and `just test-native` are green on macOS, with any pre-existing cross-platform test
   defects fixed or explicitly recorded.
2. `installers/package.sh --kind=metal` produces `knaif-<ver>-macos-arm64.zip` from a clean
   checkout, and the signed/notarized/stapled `.pkg` is produced by a scripted, documented sequence
   in F2's order — with `SHA256SUMS` generated **after** stapling.
3. `check_macho_deps.py` reports zero **unresolvable** dependencies (not merely zero
   foreign-looking paths), passes its own mutation fixtures, asserts the D9 floor and rejects
   non-arm64 slices, and runs as a required step inside `package.sh`.
4. `installers/smoke.sh` passes on the `.zip`; the `.pkg` passes E6's two gates instead, because
   `smoke.sh` structurally cannot open one.
5. **The clean room is split (D16).** The clean-room VM — **oldest supported macOS**, no Xcode, no
   CLT, no Homebrew — runs a **quarantined** artifact through a **real GGUF inference on CPU**, with
   no Gatekeeper block and no dylib load failure; the stapled `.pkg` does it **offline**. **Metal
   selected and layers offloaded** is proven on physical Apple Silicon, from a fresh user account,
   with the quarantined artifact. What Metal does inside the VM is recorded, not gated.
6. For each of ffmpeg and documents, and for each shipped model (4B and 1.7B, D14), a **saved**
   scoreboard from the snapshot's own verifier and a pinned backend is diffed against the
   **committed** `eval_snapshot.<model>.json` via an explicit `--current`, and passes; row-level
   flips against Windows/Linux are read from the committed 1.2.0 L4 extract (D17). `just parity` runs against a binary confirmed to do real inference, and is clean or has
   every diff triaged against C5's three confounds.
7. [PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md) carries a macOS machine row and a Metal backend row, measured
   by the documented methodology, with the §4 CPU trap avoided by measuring a tree with
   `libggml-metal.dylib` removed rather than by setting `KNAIF_N_GPU_LAYERS=0`.
8. [RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) can be followed end-to-end by someone who did not write it, and
   [NATIVE.md](../NATIVE.md) §12 no longer lists macOS as a limitation.
